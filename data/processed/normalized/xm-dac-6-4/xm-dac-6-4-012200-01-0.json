  "title": "Supporting the Government of Iraq: Protecting civilians impacted by explosive ordnance and enabling humanitarian action",
  "description": "The proposed project takes a strategic and comprehensive approach to clearance operations which is articulated in three pillars of work: (i) the capacity enhancement of local and national authorities to manage, regulate and coordinate a response to explosive hazards (CE), (ii) the risk education (RE) to at-risk populations, and (iii) enabling safe access to restore or facilitate use of contaminated land and infrastructure. UNMAS Iraq will coordinate its EH survey, clearance, and RE operations both with the Government of Iraq (GoI) and UN agencies as a necessary pre-requisite to follow-on efforts undertaken by those Agencies. At the strategic level, UNMAS Iraq will continue to work directly with mine action authorities to develop and/or enhance effective and sustainable systems and processes, and will work with the GoI to understand and respond to its priorities, as well as coordinating humanitarian efforts through the Mine Action Area of Responsibility (AOR).",
