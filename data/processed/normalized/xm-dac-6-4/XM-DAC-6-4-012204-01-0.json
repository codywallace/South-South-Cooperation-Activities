  "title": "Mitigation of the threat posed by explosive hazards in Gaza",
  "description": "The overall objective of this project is to reduce the threat posed by residual ERW from past and ongoing contamination as well as that posed by future armed conflicts on humanitarian response, social stabilization, and human security in Gaza. UNMAS intervention in Gaza provides direct humanitarian assistance, social stability and improved human security through mine action activities. UNMAS Palestine delivers humanitarian assistance by enabling Gazans to return to homes impacted by explosive remnants of war (ERW), and by maintaining emergency preparedness for a rapid response to conflict escalation. UNMAS supports social stabilization on a cost recovery basis, by facilitating the reconstruction of vital infrastructure and housing, while training and employing youth to deliver risk awareness education. Finally, UNMAS improves human security by reducing the threat posed by the ERW to the civilian population.",
