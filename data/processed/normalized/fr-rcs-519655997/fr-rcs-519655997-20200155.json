  "description": "Senegal was recently granted an extension of its obligations under article 5 for a further five years (2021-2026) to complete its land clearance efforts in Casamance. With regards to the current nature and extent of the contamination, Senegal could reach its objective to be mine-free by 2026. Furthermore, there is a strong and high political commitment to restore peace and releasing land to people in an effort to support the peace process and the return of internally displaced people. Since 1996, Humanité & Inclusion (Humanity & Inclusion) has been involved in strengthening the technical capacities of national organisations. More specifically, HI has closely worked with CNAMS (Centre National d’Action Antimines au Sénégal) staff in order to achieve the objective set by the Senegalese government of a mine-free country by 2026. HI is currently the only organisation accredited to implement mine action operations. HI intends to work alongside the authorities to increase its humanitarian demining programme, by adopting an integrated approach, addressing the instruments of armed violence, its immediate effects, its long-term impacts and by supporting the actors working in the area on its root causes.Under the Mine Action and Cluster Munitions Programme, HI has designed an 18-month HMA programme that will respond to the needs of the population of Casamance.",
