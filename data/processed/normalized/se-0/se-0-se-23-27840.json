  "description": "Support to humanitarian demining through UNDP and UNOPS in order to strenghten demining capacity of local actors such as SSTS, NPU and SESU. The war in Ukraine has greatly increased the country's need for support to deal with unexploded ordnance and mines. The remaining explosive remnants pose a great risk to the Ukrainian population, livestock and the very important grain production for the whole world. In addition, the remaining explosive remnants create major social disruptions as they prevent the repair of important infrastructure that has been damaged or completely destroyed. In order for Ukraine to be able to locate and destroy remaining explosive remnants, it is of crucial importance that those carrying out the clearance have the necessary technical equipment. MSB provides extensive emergency materiel support to responsible Ukrainian authorities for mine action as well as infrastructure support and expertise.",
