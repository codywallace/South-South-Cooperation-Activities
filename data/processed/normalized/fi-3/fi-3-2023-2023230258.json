  "description": "Finland supports two rehabilitation centers in Aleppo and Damascus, Syria, through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Rehabilitation centers assist victims of mine accidents, provide physical and psychosocial support and help them establish a living through microeconomic initiatives. ICRC also provides trainings to promote risk awareness and safe behavior to reduce mine accidents. Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and its volunteers will be among those trained and they will further distribute the information to local communities. Beneficiaries of these activities include local populations, disabled people and SARC as a humanitarian aid provider. Support will be channeled through the Finnish Red Cross. Finland will fund ICRC's humanitarian activities in Syria through FRC with 1,5 million euros during 2021-2025.",
