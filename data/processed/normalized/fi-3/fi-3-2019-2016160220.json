In northern Iraq and north east Syria in the areas previously occupied by ISIL MAG will co nduct 1) targeted clearance and technical survey and 2) delivery of Risk Education and Non-Technical Survey. Projects outcomes will be 1) stabilisation and socio economic reconstruction efforts are enabled through the release of land 2) personal safety and security of target groups is enhanced through increased awareness of contamination and removing the threat and 3) local and national capacity to support mine action activities is strengthened.
