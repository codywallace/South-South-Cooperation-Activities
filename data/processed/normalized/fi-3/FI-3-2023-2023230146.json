  "title": "HALO/Humanitarian Mine Action in somalia",
  "description": "In Somalia, HALO will conduct clearance of mines and other explosive devices, especially near the Somali-Ethiopian border, provide risk education, assist victims of mines and support Somali authorities in ammunition management. The project will support and strengthen Somalia’s security, stability and development through humanitarian mine action and stockpile destruction. HALO’s project seeks to enhance human security and reduce civilian accidents and casualties by limiting the impact and proliferation of explosive items. It also aims at contributing to socioeconomic development and reducing displacement. The project supports peace building by strengthening local institutions and contributing to increased stability. The beneficiaries of the project are local communities settled in areas where HALO conducts mine clearance and stockpile destruction. Finland will support HALO’s project in Somalia during 2021-2025 with 1,5 million euros.",
