In peacekeeping and emergency settings, UNMAS establishes and manages mine action coordination centres in mine-affected countries, plans and manages operations, mobilizes resources and sets mine-action priorities in the countries and territories it serves. Funding under this initiative represents Australia's core contribution to the UNMAS Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action valued at $0.3 million for the 2009-10 financial year.",
