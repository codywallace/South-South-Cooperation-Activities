  "description": "The Mine Action Universalisation and Advocacy initiative will promote universalisation and implementation of the international treaties banning landmines and cluster munitions. Specifically, the initiative will raise awareness of the issues of unexploded ordnance in Eastern Cambodia and encourage universalisation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM)and accession to the Convention by Cambodia. The research will be reflected in a dual language (Cambodian and English) to be launched at the Third Meeting of State Parties to the CCM in September 2012. A discussion forum will also be held to promote universalisation and implementation of the international treaties banning landmines and cluster munitions within the Asia-Pacific region. The total value of this initiative is $28,500 over the 2011-12 financial year.",
