However, not everyone in the community accepts families from different houses to gather in one house, especially when there are only women in the house, affecting the beneficiaries' direct reach. An additional reason for a lower number of beneficiaries reached in this quarter is the distance of the houses in remote villages, where HI is currently delivering EORE sessions. In addition, HI was waiting for new Task Orders (TO) from DMA in January, which was finally issued in February. Therefore, the presented numbers reflect two months of implementation. HI has also conducted eight indirect EORE sessions through the modified approach of EORE delivery - dissemination of key safe messages by loudspeakers - reaching additional 565 beneficiaries in the Hawija and Daquq districts, including an estimated 113 men, 113 women, 168 boys, and 171 girls.

The team continues to face challenges in bringing multiple families together in one location/house to conduct group sessions reaching a larger number of people, thus limiting the beneficiaries' direct reach. In addition, since most of the sessions were held during working hours, men were underrepresented in the sessions, since they were working. According to accident figures and the KAP survey conducted by HI, the population that is most at risk are young men and heads of households. HI will aim to conduct more group sessions to extend its reach with a special focus on outdoor sessions, especially in the primary health care centres, markets, or other places with gatherings, to ensure beneficiaries who cannot be reached at home receive sessions.",

The team continues to face challenges in bringing multiple families together in one location/house to conduct group sessions. However, providing an explanation at the beginning of each session of the importance of gathering people in a group to learn from other experiences and share knowledge led to increased direct beneficiary reach. In addition, HI adapted to conducting direct EORE sessions in primary health care centres (PHCC) in the target location, as most PHCCs receive visitors from areas surrounding the target areas, which are not easily accessible to HI due to access, security and capacity constraints. HI is progressing toward approval from the Ministry of Education to conduct a direct EORE session for children in schools with the start of the new seasons for study, most likely from the end of October.",

However, once the school year began, HI approached the Ministry of Education (MoE) and Kirkuk Director of Education (DoE) to conduct direct EORE sessions for children in order to target this age group, which are at particular risk of EO accidents. After obtaining the approval, HI started to conduct school sessions in October. The team had access issues, including delays at checkpoints and a long distance to reach the targeted area. Therefore, they could not coverï¿½many classes in the schools. Additionally, some school administrations were strict in how they chose to assign classes for the sessions. However, the sessions were well-received and accepted by the students.",

    "HI conducted the fourth EORE retention assessment in March 2023 to measure the knowledge retention of participants who received sessions between October 2022 and January 2023. In total, HI conducted 115 retention surveys, including 24 men, 24 women, 34 boys, and 33 girls. The retention survey result showed 98% of the beneficiaries had retained their knowledge increase compared to the pre-test. It is worth mentioning that HI will continue measuring the knowledge retention of participants who received sessions between October 2022 and January 2023 in the following periods.Once the sample is completed, the results will then be extrapolated to the RE population.",
    "In June 2023, HI conducted the fifth EORE retention assessment to measure the knowledge retention of participants who had received sessions between October 2022 and January 2023. This was an additional assessment carried out to increase the sample size of the retention test and ensure that the results can be reasonably extrapolated to give an accurate overall estimate of how many beneficiairies retained their knowledge. The increased sample size is sufficient to be confident in the findings, however it should be noted that the sample is not fully representative of the beneficiary population, as it is challenging to follow up with children reached through schools, and women, who are culturally less willing to provide contact details.  HI conducted a total of 116 retention surveys, including 79 men, 31 women, three boys, and three girls. The results showed that 98.2% of the beneficiaries had retained their knowledge increase compared to the pre-test. The sample result was then extrapolated to represent all participants who received sessions during that same period. The total number of direct EORE beneficiaries for the measured period was 11,781, indicating that 11,578 beneficiaries demonstrated retention of the knowledge related to the risks posed by Explosive Ordnance (EO). The assessment also identified some areas where further reinforcement of messages would be beneficial, in particular what to do when encountering a suspicious object, and in the event of an accident. Identification and recognition of hazards was generally strong.",
    "Risk Education activity are planned to be launched in Iraq in June 2021",
    "As mentioned in previous quarterly report - Risk Education activities started in June 2021. During the reporting period, HI conducted 10 direct EORE outdoor sessions in Hawija, reaching a total of 48 beneficiaries. HI also introduced dissemination of key EORE messages via loudspeakers - a modality which HI has introduced as a complementary activity to direct session following the COVID-19 pandemic. HI conducted 26 loudspeakers sessions in Hawija, targeting a total of 455 indirect beneficiaries - that are not counted under this indicator.",
    "HI conducted 42 direct sessions reaching 556 beneficiaries in Daquq and Hawija districts. However, not everyone in the community accepts door-to-door sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting beneficiaries' direct reach. In Q4, HI plans to target schools to increase the number of children reached and community-based societies or forums such as farmer's societies and village development committees to increase the number of adults reached through direct RE sessions. HI has also conducted 64 indirect RE sessions through the modified approach of RE delivery - dissemination of key safe messages by loudspeakers - reaching 1,465 beneficiaries in the Hawija and Daquq districts. This correspond to a new indicator that HI as requested BUZA in the Annual Plans submission, but which was not validated before November 25th and therefore not considered in QR3.",
    "HI conducted 183 direct sessions reaching 2247 beneficiaries in Hawija and Daquq districts. However, not everyone in the community accepts door-to-door sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting beneficiaries' direct reach. In Dec 2021, HI reached seven schools in Hawija and Daquq in order to reach children, a key at-risk group. HI has also conducted 21 indirect EORE sessions through the modified approach of EORE delivery - dissemination of key safe messages by loudspeakers - reaching additional 2,695 beneficiaries in the Hawija and Daquq districts, including 541 men, 541 women, 805 boys, and 808 girls. Note that this will be counted under indicator 1.2.6 at annual report stage.HI continues providing direct alongside alternative indirect EORE activities, however the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the direct house to house activities considerably. As a mitigation step, HI requested and received a new task order for villages in Hawija to target additional communities and will continue both modalities to increase the beneficiary reach.",
    "HI conducted 168 direct sessions reaching 2,161 beneficiaries in Hawija and Daquq districts. However, not everyone in the community accepts families from different houses to gather in one house, especially when there are only women in the house, affecting the beneficiaries' direct reach. An additional reason for a lower number of beneficiaries reached in this quarter is the distance of the houses in remote villages, where HI is currently delivering EORE sessions. In addition, HI was waiting for new Task Orders (TO) from DMA in January, which was finally issued in February. Therefore, the presented numbers reflect two months of implementation. HI has also conducted eight indirect EORE sessions through the modified approach of EORE delivery - dissemination of key safe messages by loudspeakers - reaching additional 565 beneficiaries in the Hawija and Daquq districts, including an estimated 113 men, 113 women, 168 boys, and 171 girls. Note that this will be counted under indicator 1.2.6 at the annual report stage.HI continues providing direct alongside alternative indirect EORE activities, HI will start conducting more group sessions with a special focus on the outdoor sessions, especially in the markets, streets, or any places with gatherings, and liaise with Mukhtars to enable village groups session. Previously, the pandemic was not permitting this kind of activity. Additionally, HI will revise the session's curriculum to reduce the time that will allow for faster movement between houses and villages in remote locations.",
    "HI conducted 207 direct sessions reaching 1,516 beneficiaries in Hawija and Daquq districts. The team continues to face challenges in bringing multiple families together in one location/house to conduct group sessions reaching a larger number of people, thus limiting the beneficiaries' direct reach. In addition, since most of the sessions were held during working hours, men were underrepresented in the sessions, since they were working. According to accident figures and the KAP survey conducted by HI, the population that is most at risk are young men and heads of households. HI will aim to conduct more group sessions to extend its reach with a special focus on outdoor sessions, especially in the primary health care centres, markets, or other places with gatherings, to ensure beneficiaries who cannot be reached at home receive sessions.",
    "HI conducted 310 direct sessions reaching 3,158 beneficiaries in Hawija district. The team continues to face challenges in bringing multiple families together in one location/house to conduct group sessions. However, providing an explanation at the beginning of each session of the importance of gathering people in a group to learn from other experiences and share knowledge led to increased direct beneficiary reach. In addition, HI adapted to conducting direct EORE sessions in primary health care centres (PHCC) in the target location, as most PHCCs receive visitors from areas surrounding the target areas, which are not easily accessible to HI due to access, security and capacity constraints. HI is progressing toward approval from the Ministry of Education to conduct a direct EORE session for children in schools with the start of the new seasons for study, most likely from the end of October.",
    "HI conducted 391 direct sessions reaching 6,874 beneficiaries in Hawija district. The team continued to face challenges in bringing multiple families together in one location/house to conduct group sessions. However, once the school year began, HI approached the Ministry of Education (MoE) and Kirkuk Director of Education (DoE) to conduct direct EORE sessions for children in order to target this age group, which are at particular risk of EO accidents. After obtaining the approval, HI started to conduct school sessions in October. The team had access issues, including delays at checkpoints and a long distance to reach the targeted area. Therefore, they could not coverï¿½many classes in the schools. Additionally, some school administrations were strict in how they chose to assign classes for the sessions. However, the sessions were well-received and accepted by the students.",
    "HI conducted 347 direct sessions reaching 8,060 beneficiaries in Hawija and Dibis district. During the reporting period, the teams targeted schools as children are considered an at-risk groups of EO accidents. The team faced the challenge of delays at checkpoints, and long distances to reach the targeted area and could not cover as many classes in the schools as originally planned. Alongside the direct EORE sessions, a second mass media campaign started in January to disseminate key safe messages through different approaches such as radio broadcasting, wall painting, posters, and social media, including Facebook and Instagram advertisement.",
    "HI conducted 23 direct sessions, reaching 727 beneficiaries in Hawija district. The team continued to target schools as children are considered an at-risk group for EO accidents. However, the team encountered challenges during the end-of-school season when final exams were conducted. The team coordinated with the headmasters of the schools to keep the students for the sessions. The team had to wait until all the students finished their exams before starting the sessions. Additionally, there were delays in the task order, which HI submitted to DMA on the 27th of April but was not issued until the 17th of May.",

    "During the reporting period, HI carried out the CFPs selection process. The community focal point training is planned for the first and second quarter of 2022.",
    "HI conducted training for 23 new community focal points (CFP) from Hawija and Daquq on the 29th and 30th of March 2022. These CFPs will receive quality assurance (QA) visits in the following months. Each CFP should pass two positive QA, after which they will receive a certificate.",
    "HI conducted training for 33 new community focal points (CFP) including 26 males and 7 females from Hawija and Daquq on the 15th and 16th of June 2022. HI conducted quality assurance (QA) for 17 CFPs and plans to conduct more QA visits in the following months. Each CFP should pass two positive QA in order to receive a certificate.",
    "HI continued to conduct quality assurance (QA) for the community focal points (CFP). 55 CFPs who passed two QAs were invited for one-day refresher training. HI divided the CFPs into two groups among the 50 who attended (one group with 24 CFPs and the second group with 26) and conducted two refresher trainings during two days. The main objective of the refresher training was to provide a space for the CFPs to practice provision of direct EORE sessions whilst receiving immediate feedback and comments for improvement. HI provided all the IEC materials used for the direct EORE session to each of the CFPs as a resource to provide EORE sessions sustainibly over the longer term. A completion certificate was provided to each CFP who participated. The next training will be conducted in December targeting teachers and headmasters of schools.",
    "HI carried out the community focal points (CFP) selection process and conducted training for eight new CFPs, including teachers and headmasters of the target schools. The participant included five men and three women from Riyadh and Zab sub-districts of Hawija District and Al-Adiliya village of Yaiji sub-district in Kirkuk Governorate on the 18th and 19th of December 2022. HI will start to conduct quality assurance (QA) for the eight CFPs in the following months. Each CFP should pass two positive QA in order to be able to conduct EORE sessions.",
    "During the period, HI conducted Quality Assurance for the eight community focal point (CFPs) trained in December 2022, and as a result, all eight CFPs passed two QA visits and were invited for a one-day refresher training. The main objective of the refresher training is to provide a space for the CFPs to practice the provision of direct EORE sessions whilst receiving immediate feedback and comments for improvement. HI provided IEC materials  to each of the CFPs as a resource to provide EORE sessions sustainably over the longer term and a completion certificate was provided to each CFP who participated. Teachers' CFPs showed motivation and conducted sessions for the students in schools using HI materials.",
    "During the reporting period, HI conducted follow-up interviews with 54 CFPs out of 64 to gather insights into the challenges and frequency of delivering EORE sessions in the community. The majority of CFPs have been actively delivering EORE sessions, which is a positive indication for the sustainability of the project activites. Some lessons learned and further support needs for th CFPs were also collected through the interviews."
