    "Senegal was recently granted an extension of its obligations under article 5 for a further five years (2021-2026) to complete its land clearance efforts in Casamance. With regards to the current nature and extent of the contamination, Senegal could reach its objective to be mine-free by 2026. Furthermore, there is a strong and high political commitment to restore peace and releasing land to people in an effort to support the peace process and the return of internally displaced people. Since 1996, Humanité & Inclusion (Humanity & Inclusion) has been involved in strengthening the technical capacities of national organisations. More specifically, HI has closely worked with CNAMS (Centre National d’Action Antimines au Sénégal) staff in order to achieve the objective set by the Senegalese government of a mine-free country by 2026. HI is currently the only organisation accredited to implement mine action operations. HI intends to work alongside the authorities to increase its humanitarian demining programme, by adopting an integrated approach, addressing the instruments of armed violence, its immediate effects, its long-term impacts and by supporting the actors working in the area on its root causes.Under the Mine Action and Cluster Munitions Programme, HI has designed an 18-month HMA programme that will respond to the needs of the population of Casamance."

    "The percentage of direct beneficiaries demonstrating safer behaviour through Risk Education (RE) was assessed using a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey. Safer behaviour was measured through three sub-indicators: (1) avoidance of contaminated areas, (2) appropriate reaction to an explosive ordnance (EO), and (3) recognition of the importance of reporting an EO. Baseline data collected among individuals who had not received RE showed an average score of 69.0% for adults and 54.0% for children, resulting in an overall reference score of 61.5%. In contrast, endline results for individuals who participated in RE sessions showed significantly improved averages: 74.7% for adults and 85.7% for children. Since 100% of RE beneficiaries achieved scores higher than the baseline average, we conclude that 100% of direct beneficiaries demonstrated safer behaviours following the Risk Education intervention. detailed calculation is available in the KAP report.",

As a result, all clearance activities were conducted manually.

However, several constraints hindered the effective mobilization of technical resources, thereby slowing down operations and jeopardizing HI�s ability to meet its commitments. For instance, following the appointment of a new director at CNAMS, HI submitted a request for the accreditation of technical survey dogs on June 26, 2023.
