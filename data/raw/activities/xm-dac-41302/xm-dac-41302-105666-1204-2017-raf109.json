    "The project helps address skills mismatch and high youth unemployment through promotion of work-based learning (WBL) in the target countries (i.e. Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria). It implements twofold strategies: 1) promotion of evidence-based social dialogue for the improvement of WBL systems; and 2) regional cooperation and peer-to-peer learning. The current WBL system in each country will be analysed with a view to strengthening labour market relevance of WBL through enhancing employers’ engagement, which will help social dialogue and forge shared visions to improve the system. Since the target countries are at a similar stage of development with comparable socio-economic conjunctures, peer-to-peer learning is an effective intervention to counter skills mismatch in the region."
