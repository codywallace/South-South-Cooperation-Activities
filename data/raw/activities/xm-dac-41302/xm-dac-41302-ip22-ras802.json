    "85 young trade union activists representing all the major organisations in South Asia formed a network to develop and share initiatives to organise campaigns and activities to ensure safe and healthy workplaces. The youth activists developed digital campaign materials for the workers on the safety and benefits of joining trade unions.\n25 WOs from 19 countries in the region improved their educational department and offerings through the development of online education programmes to attract new members, including youth and women through a south-south cooperation project.\nAs a follow-up on the resolution adopted at the South Asian Trade Union Conference “Building Trade Union Power in the Changing World of Work: Protecting Workers, Promoting Social Justice”, unions in India & Bangladesh developed action plan promoting better social dialogue practices. In Sri Lanka, several memoranda were submitted to government to activate the National Labour Advisory Council. ILO supported unions in the roundtable discussions at the AP Forum on Sustainable Development in 2022&2023. ILO collaborated with ESCAP in organising roundtable discussion of SDG17 which helped promote ILO’s mandate of tripartism & SD. \nJul 2023, ILO convened Pacific Unions’ Capacity Building and Action-Oriented meeting in Fiji and commissioned on a study on TU engagement in UNSCDF in small island states in AP. Recommendations helped unions identify pathways in proactive engagement in SDG&UNSCDF processes. \nWith support from Japan, ILO developed a JT mini-Toolkit for the chemical & pharmaceutical sectors and recommended guiding principles and best practices for a JT which was adopted by WO to formulate strategies to promote DW in the green JT. Toolkit provides practical advice to WO, EO, govt and communities in driving behaviours and practices towards cleaner and safer workplace and environment. WO engaged with employers in SD for facilitating a JT and cooperated with CBO to monitor the environmental impacts and improve compliance in the industries.\nOct 2022, ILO organised a sub-regional conference in PHL where WO from 10 SEA countries adopted a joint resolution to revitalize in a changing world of work and outlined concrete measures to collaborate & create a just, sustainable and fair economy that enables DW for all. TU understood the importance and urgency of moving forward and renewing the labour movement and agreed to work collectively to ensure a strong and active ATUC as a SD partner by ASEAN to engage and influence labour policies in the sub-region.\nWith support from Japan, ILO supported WO and EO in SEA to conduct the High-Level Tripartite Regional Seminar on Industrial Relations in SEA Countries.\nILO delivered key capacity-building programmes to WO in AP through blended learning on SD for solutions. The course enhanced the capacity of workers to effectively participate in SD as a pillar of DW.",
    "ASEAN Trade Union Council (ATUC) and affiliates opted to change status from participants to observers at the 15th AFML due to concerns on the denial of the nomination and participation of Confederation of Trade Unions of Myanmar by ASEAN Secretariat. While ATUC and affiliates withdrew participation, through the informal lobbying to other stakeholders, ATUC and affiliates managed to influence the final recommendation which highlighted the workers agenda and workers’ rights.\nSouth-East Asian workers organizations have undertaken union revitalization strategies and concrete measures to collaborate and create a just, sustainable and fair economy, that enables decent work for all workers. They have agreed to work collectively to ensure a strong and active ASEAN Trade Union Council (ATUC).  ATUC is now a member of the ASEAN Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Council allowing to participate in regional education programmes to support the advancement of TVET in ASEAN. \nTrade Unions in the Pacific Islands adopted their position statement on labour mobility in the Pacific as a policy framework to reach out to seasonal migrant workers and to take action in protecting their rights. The members of the Pacific Islands Council of Trade Unions designed approaches to ensure that migrant workers become part of the union of the sending countries. Pacific Islands Council of Trade Unions (PICTU) was invited (first time).\nUNESCAP Asia Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development 2023 report included ‘strengthening of labour unions to ensure respect for fundamental rights’ as one priority areas of actions based on union proposals. \nUNRCs in India, Fiji and PNG committed to regular interaction and collaboration with trade unions to work on achieving SDG. A study was commissioned to develop a strategy for the better engagement of Pacific unions in the processes of UNSCDF& SDG. Good south south practice was showcased at Pacific & Caribbean States union meeting, Nov 2023. ILO & Public Services International–Asia Pacific (PSI AP) provided social dialogue mechanisms and expertise in organization, outreach, mobilization and bargaining aimed at increasing membership through a series of training for precarious workers in the health and social care sectors.\nILO disseminated survey to gather substantial data on working conditions of healthcare workers which provided basis and inputs in the 2022 ILC discussions on ILO Nursing Personnel Convention, 1977 (No 149). PSI AP and ILO provided training and capacity building opportunities. \nMigrant Worker Resource Centres (MRC) supported by ILO in Southeast Asia are managed in partnership with governments, trade unions (TU) and CSOs. With an intention to replicate more centers, ILO organized online regional meeting in 6/2022 purposed to provide an opportunity to network and strengthen TU’s work in protecting migrant workers’ rights. ILO published a paper on TU-led MRC in ASEAN and Jordan (2022). The paper facilitates cross-border information sharing and cross-country cooperation. \nIn 6/2022, a network of migrant workers’ unions took form to share innovative strategies & services offered to migrant workers and in protecting their rights. It contributed good practices to an ILO paper that features good approaches and innovations by TU using the MRC as an organizing tool by way of counselling, legal aid, education/training, and networking.\nIn 3/2023, ILO organised the Youth TU Volunteers Camp on OSH. More than 85 young TU representing major WOs in South Asia attended the event and created a network to prepare actions plans and campaigns on OSH. \nILO supported the negotiations for ATUC to join the ASEAN TVET Council. \nILO organised a capacity training programme entitled “Training of Trainers” for unions in AP. Participants gained relevant skills in digital learning that helped them become better skilled trainers, for delivering innovative trade union education for their organization and members."
