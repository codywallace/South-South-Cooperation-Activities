    "With institutional capacity building and the adoption of digitalisation within partner organisations, the digital transformation has progressed well in 2022.  18 TVET institutions signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for long-term peer-to-peer collaboration in the provision of the blended and green TVET; 20 MoUs on public and private partnerships were concluded for skilling, reskilling, and upskilling. At least 980 trainees (54% women) completed a blended and green TVET course; 100 (40% female) received on-the-job training in rural infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance; 194 tourism professionals (113 females) got skill upgrading in food cooking and beverage. 14 instructors and 40 teachers completed the Training of Trainer (ToT) in web design, machining, mechatronics, plastering, masonry, air-conditioner, and elevator repair and maintenance; 30 assessors trained in digital recognition of prior learning (eRPL) in these occupations and some occupations in tourism and hospitality; 200 tourism workers (56% women) were assessed through and certified using an eRPL assessment tool. ILO supported the participants from the Director-General Office of Technical and Vocational Education Training (DGTVET) to attend the ITC course of Digital Transformation of Skills Development from 12 to 14 December 2022.  ILO supported the Department of Vocational Orientation (VOD) to provide coaching and mentoring to schools currently implementing local life skills education and expanding to 60 other new schools in 2022, benefiting 55,562 adolescents and youths (52% were female).  ILO provided technical support to develop climate-change reference documents and six-step problem-based learning lesson plans for primary and secondary school teachers. These materials were piloted in 2023 with the engagement of student councils to promote climate-change-focused life skills education led by adolescents. On the other hand, DEY II supported MoEYS to promote blended learning by enrolling 1,500 teachers and school directors into an e-learning course on local life skills education in 2022 and the incoming 2023.",
    "A total of 195,900 youths (of whom 51% were female) directly benefited from the training programmes in 2020-2022, including industry-driven Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) and vocational skills training; basic education equivalency and literacy in factory programmes; entrepreneurship and enterprise development training and support; employment services; capacity building for youth participation in policy dialogues and youth rights at work awareness-raising. In addition, 4,830 (35% of them were female) indirectly benefited from support to new youth-owned startups and existing businesses and SMEs. The ILO, as the lead agency, collaborated with the UN on Decent Employment for Youth in Cambodia. ILO conducted a satisfaction survey with 20% of 128 Air-Condition dealers, of whom 350 technicians were upskilled on the use of new Air-Conditioner Technology and on professional ethics. 85% of them reported satisfaction with the performance of their young technicians who were upskilled.  ILO supported MLVT, TVET institutions, and the private sector to establish 28 Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) between TVET institutions and private companies to develop skills development programmes to meet the demand of the private sector and industry [two in 2022, one in 2021, and 25 in 2022.",
    "DGTVET revised its TVET programmes and its SOPAC (Standard Operating Procedures of Apprenticeship in Cambodia), with inputs   from constituents, to integrate green and digital competencies. The ILO provided technical support to DGTVET to draft SOPAC (Standard Operating Procedures of Apprenticeship in Cambodia).  The ILO provided capacity support to DGTVET and TVET schools to keep their TVET centre responsive and demand-driven through training on TVET centre management.   The ILO supported coordination among stakeholders - TVET schools and private sectors as well as skills development funds - in providing their inputs and informing their demands through the process of blended TVET Programme development",
    "The development of blended TVET programmes has provided flexible access to TVET opportunities to those who are vulnerable workers and youths who could not afford to be physically present at their TVET school for the whole programme. The development of TVET programmes for people with disability, in collaboration with DGTVET/MoLVT,  was completed in 2023. Technical support to DGTVET and TVET schools on the design of the blended programmes have been made available.  In 2023, ILO cooperated with ITCILO to provide some capacity building to our partners for designing the blended programmes, including RPL.",
    "Access to skills recognition has been improved through the development of blended Recognition of Prior Learning using blended RPL assessment packages and an online RPL Platform. NCTP has developed and upgraded eRPL for skills assessment and certification in the hospitality sector. DGVET has recently launched the eRPL platform and assessment for several sectors starting construction and manufacturing sectors. Blended Recognition of Prior Learning has been introduced by the ILO to major TVET stakeholders. In addition, ILO provided a series of funding support to NCTP to develop and upgrade the blended assessment packages and platform. For DGTVET, the ILO provided a first introductory training on eRPL and technical inputs and backstopping for the development online RPL platform. The TVET schools funded the ILO, blended assessment packages have been developed and expanded and used in eRPL platform.",
    "Constituents recognized Skills mismatch and are taking action to fill the gaps. Both private and government agencies provided inputs to rematch the skills needs and updated their training curricula so that the graduate’s qualification meets the industrial demands. For example, the work-based learning model is now in development. The blended approach has been in use. The integration of green and digital skills into existing curricula is another evidence of keeping the skills matched and anticipating future skills change. The ILO provided coordination support to stakeholders in providing their inputs and informed their demands through the process of blended TVET Programme development. Technical expertise was provided to constituents to integrate green and digital competencies into the existing TVET programme. The ILO provided capacity support to DGTVET and TVET schools to keep their TVET centre responsive and demand-driven through training on TVET centre management."
