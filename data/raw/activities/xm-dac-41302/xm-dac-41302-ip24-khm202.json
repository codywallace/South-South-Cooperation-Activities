    "The CPO KHM202 addresses the pressing issue of a widespread mismatch between the skills of Cambodian youth and the evolving demands of the labour market, particularly within the context of the country’s shift toward a higher-value-added economy. This systemic mismatch, highlighted by high rates of under- and over-qualification, especially among youth with only high school education or vocational training, undermines the potential for decent employment and economic transformation. The expected results during the biennium include improving the quality, relevance, and recognition of technical and vocational education and training (TVET), enhancing private sector engagement in skills development, and advancing mutual recognition of skills within the ASEAN region. The primary beneficiaries of this initiative are Cambodian youth, especially those from poor and vulnerable backgrounds who face significant barriers to acquiring market-relevant skills. TVET institutions, both public and private, also benefit from capacity development support, while the private sector stands to gain from a better-prepared and more adaptable workforce. The strategy is implemented in collaboration with national authorities such as the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training and the Ministry of Tourism, as well as regional stakeholders and development partners. While the initiative is rooted in the Royal Government of Cambodia’s policies and frameworks, international partners such as the ILO and Korea Programme provide critical financial and technical assistance. Collaborative mechanisms, such as the development of Standard Operating Procedures on Apprenticeship and the piloting of Mutual Recognition of Skills between Cambodia and Thailand, further illustrate the cross-sectoral and regional nature of this effort. Through these partnerships, the programme seeks to align education and training systems with labour market needs and foster sustainable pathways to decent work."
