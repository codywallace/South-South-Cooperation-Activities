    "Through the ‘Promoting Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in the World of Work’ component of the ILO/Norway Partnership Agreement (PA) the ILO will continue to work with governments and social partners to develop the knowledge base on gender equality in the workplace; promote representation, advocacy and voice for women workers; and build the capacity of constituents to promote gender equality. Given the inter-regional nature of the initiative, there will also be a strong emphasis on knowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation. The overriding aim will be to build upon and consolidate what has been achieved in the first phase of the ILO/Norway PA, and indeed through earlier PAs, such that the ILO’s approaches and tools will be embedded and on-going."
