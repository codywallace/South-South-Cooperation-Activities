    "In 2023, external pressures intensified, marked by persistent conflicts in Eastern Europe and emerging conflicts in the Gaza Strip. These geopolitical tensions compounded inflationary shocks stemming from COVID-19 imbalances and internal crises within retail companies. In Brazil, the new government faced hurdles in advancing its agenda due to opposition parties holding a legislative majority, hindering the promotion of public policies aimed at economic growth and poverty reduction. Brazil's economic recovery, evident after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, saw growth in GDP and employment. In 2023, GDP increased by 2.9%, with the employed population reaching 101 million, the highest since 2012. However, informality and low wages persist, with 39.5 million workers in informal employment and an average real remuneration of R$3,134. Addressing informality and improving labor conditions, including combating child and forced labor, remains crucial for social justice and a fairer future. \nThe ILO Office in Brazil plans strategic collaboration with Brazilian constituents over the next two years to advance labor rights and strengthen multilateral partnerships and cooperation to promote integrated policy responses for social justice through decent work in Brazil by the end of 2025. Initiatives include the Federal Government joining the Global Coalition for Social Justice, the implementation of the Lula-Biden Initiative and the participation of constituents in the process of monitoring UNSDCF initiatives, the launch of the first Brazilian DWCP by Federal Government, Employers' and Workers' Organizations in the context of the National Labor Commission, with contributions from the UNSDCF and PPA 2024-2027, the implementation by the Regional Labor Court (TRT4) of a work plan that includes a new partnership within the scope of the program of South-South cooperation with LAC countries to promote exchanges between members of the judiciary, the promotion by the Brazilian Governmen"
