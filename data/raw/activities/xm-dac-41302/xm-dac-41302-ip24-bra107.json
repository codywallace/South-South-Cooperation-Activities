    "In 2023, external pressures intensified, marked by persistent conflicts in Eastern Europe and emerging conflicts in the Gaza Strip. These geopolitical tensions compounded inflationary shocks stemming from COVID-19 imbalances and internal crises within retail companies. In Brazil, the new government faced hurdles in advancing its agenda due to opposition parties holding a legislative majority, hindering the promotion of public policies aimed at economic growth and poverty reduction. Brazil's economic recovery, evident after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, saw growth in GDP and employment. In 2023, GDP increased by 2.9%, with the employed population reaching 101 million, the highest since 2012. However, informality and low wages persist, with 39.5 million workers in informal employment and an average real remuneration of R$3,134. Addressing informality and improving labour conditions, including combating child and forced labour, remains crucial for social justice and a fairer future. The ILO Office in Brazil plans strategic collaboration with Brazilian constituents over the next two years to promote labour rights and strengthen public policies to promote the inclusion and formalization of vulnerable workers and to facilitate the implementation of sectoral OSH regulations. Initiatives include the adoption of policies and initiatives by the Public Ministry, Labor Court (TRT8), Federal and State Governments and the Private Sector to include traditional peoples and support poverty reduction; the adoption by the Brazilian government: of measures to create a South-South cooperation program for the productive inclusion of traditional communities, of the National Equal Pay Policy, of the National Decent Work Plan for LGBTQIA+ People, of the National Youth Viva Plan, of policies to increase opportunities for indigenous peoples and productive inclusion and measures to reconsider its policy related to human trafficking; strengthening the National Indigenous Health Program; th"
