    "The CPO KHM201 addresses the critical challenge of improving the quality of employment in Cambodia, where strong economic growth has not yet led to equitable or decent work for all. Despite a 5.7 percent annual rise in GDP per capita since 2010, about 88 percent of workers aged 15 and older remain in informal employment, with youth, rural populations, and other vulnerable groups disproportionately affected. These workers often endure poor wages, unsafe working conditions, limited access to social protection, and heightened vulnerability to economic and environmental shocks. During the biennium, the CPO supports national efforts to enhance decent employment, with a focus on youth, women, persons with disabilities, and the self-employed. It contributes to the ongoing implementation of the National Employment Policy (NEP) 2015–2025 and its integration into the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training’s Strategic Development Plan 2024–2028. The programme also helps operationalize provincial NEP action plans and supports the upcoming Labour Force Survey, which will apply international standards to improve understanding of informality, migration, and employment trends. Implemented in partnership with UN agencies and development partners from Switzerland, China, and ASEAN-focused initiatives, the CPO promotes inclusive labour market interventions. These include support for job matching via the National Employment Agency and expanded access to skills development and entrepreneurship training. A key initiative is the Joint Programme on Decent Employment, which integrates employment, skills, and social protection strategies and is expected to benefit 2.3 million Cambodians. This includes piloting a Graduation-Based Social Protection Scheme that supports vulnerable households in transitioning from social assistance to sustainable livelihoods."
