    "In Kenya, significant gaps in social protection coverage affect vulnerable populations, including informal economy workers, people living with HIV, individuals with disabilities, refugees, and migrant workers. The Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) seeks to enhance social protection mechanisms in alignment with Article 43 of the Kenyan Constitution, which guarantees socio-economic rights to all citizens. This ILO's Country Programme Outcome (CPO) in Kenya focuses on enhancing social protection mechanisms for these vulnerable groups. It aligns with the constitutional guarantee of socio-economic rights and the ILO's standards on social security, aiming to expand coverage and improve the adequacy of benefits for all Kenyans, including those at risk of being left behind.\nThe program seeks to improve access to essential social protection services by supporting the development of inclusive policies, strengthening social protection institutions, and fostering legislative reforms. This includes enhancing the legal framework for social protection, particularly through the expansion of universal health coverage, pension systems, and unemployment insurance. Special attention is given to ensuring that populations such as rural workers, informal economy workers, and marginalized groups benefit from these systems.\nKey outcomes include the development and piloting of strategies to extend social protection to rural and informal economy workers, the introduction of a universal disability benefit, and the integration of refugees into the national social security system. Furthermore, the program supports capacity building for institutions and officials involved in delivering social protection, ensuring that these services are digitized, sustainable, and adequately financed.\nThe ILO collaborates closely with the Government of Kenya, UN agencies, and development partners to implement this program. By 2025, the expected result is a more inclusive and equitable social protection syst"
