    "1. National and sectoral trade unions in the region took effective measures to protect the labour rights and safety of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, after sharing national experiences of showcases at regional webinars organised by the ILO. \n\n2. Trade unions were also able to establish stronger partnerships with UNESCAP, the UN Regional Development Coordination Office (DCO), and country UNRCs through interactive regional forums on SDGs (held on Feb 25, April 27, and Sept 23, 2021, respectively).  Unions were able to demand  support for the integration of ILO agendas of international labour standards, decent work and Future of Work in the SDGs and UNSDCFs. Unions also succeeded in highlighting  the need for trade unioin engagement in the implementation oand monitoring of SDGs and establish their distinct representation from that of NGOs/CSOs.  \n\n3. The importance of engaging with unions within the context of the Asia-Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development (APFSD) was also realized last March 2021 when the report of APFSD in 2021 highlighted the relevance of union participation in the annual regional review of SDGs.\n ILO ACTRAV-ACFTU South-South Cooperation Project provided resources to enhance the institutional capacities of trade unions in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nILO produced and widely disseminated a union reference manual on SDGs  and held knowledge-sharing regional forums on SDGs involving UNESCAP and UNRCs.  \n\nILO developed an organising tool (publication) for trade unions, held a regional webinar on MRC, and provided technical and financial assistance to International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) to reach out to Indonesia domestic workers in Malaysia.\nILO organised regional forums on skills and lifelong learning to introduce ILO skills policy and standard-setting on apprenticeships and is developing a regional policy brief on skills development and lifelong learning. \nILO provided technical and financial assistance to these studies."
