    "The Brazilian Government and the social partners are committed to the promotion of green jobs and the eradication of forced labour. The project builds on a highly effective model of advisory services and partnerships with government, social partners and the private sector in Brazil to generate concerted action promoting decent work. The project addresses the fight against forced labour and the promotion of green jobs in complementary, mutually reinforcing ways: on the one hand, focusing on the provision of instruments that will deepen corporate social responsibility and enhance public policies related to the two themes, and, on the other hand, strengthening the capacity of key actors to establish links and build synergies between these two issues in the application of instruments in policy making and implementation. The approaches developed and tested in Brazil through this project are likely to be transferred and adapted to third developing countries through the Brazil-ILO South-South Cooperation Programme on Forced Labour and Green Jobs as well as through the ILO’s Global Programme on Green Jobs and the Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour (SAP-FL)."
