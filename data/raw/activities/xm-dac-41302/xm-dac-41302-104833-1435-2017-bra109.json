    "This Partnership Programme is part of the Complementary Agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the International Labour Organization for Technical Cooperation with Other Countries in Latin America and African Countries for the implementation of the Partnership Programme ILO / Brazil for the Promotion of South-South Cooperation, signed in Geneva on March 22,2009. The Programme aims to systematize best practices, experiences and expertise developed in Brazil in the areas of prevention and eradication of forced labour and the promotion of green jobs and also support their dissemination and adaptation to socioeconomic and institutional reality in other developing countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. For the execution of this Partnership Programme, the term South-South Cooperation should be understood as a mechanism to promote the exchange of experiences, information and knowledge among developing countries, based on the dissemination, adaptation and exchange of good practices to tackle a given problem or situation. It is relevant to notice that decent work is the focal point of the ILO's four strategic objectives: promote fundamental rights at work, employment, social protection and social dialogue. Thus, the primary purpose of the ILO is to promote opportunities so that men and women can get a decent and productive work in conditions offreedom, equality, security and dignity. The ILO's role is to facilitate and encourage this process, with actions aligned to the Decent Work National Agenda (DWNA) and the Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP), and constant connection with other intersections developed in countries that will benefit from this partnership. Specifically, it is up to the ILO to support the systematization of Brazilian experiences developed, the validation on its best practices and lessons learned and its dissemination throughout countries involved in the Cooperation. The immediate objective of this Programme is to promote the exchange of good practices in the activity of promoting green jobs in the forestry sector and the prevention and combating of forced labour carried out by Brazilian institutions in charge of these policies and their counterparts in developing countries members of-this cooperation. It is intended, with the activities developed by this project: 1.1 Contribute to the prevention and eradication of forced labour; 1.2 Encourage the promotion of decent jobs and green jobs in the forestry sector, in order to contribute to a socially just transition to an economy based on low carbon emissions, both in the regional and global levels."
