    "The CPO KHM204 addresses the critical issue of widespread informality and limited access to decent work within Cambodia’s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). While MSMEs contribute 58% to the national GDP and employ 70% of the workforce, only 12% are formally registered, perpetuating informal employment. Women and youth, especially young women, are particularly prevalent in this sector, often relying on micro-entrepreneurship as their entry into the labour market. However, their growth is hindered by challenges like low financial and digital literacy, limited access to credit, and inadequate business support. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these vulnerabilities, especially for women-led businesses, which lacked protections to survive, leading to increased exits from the workforce and a rise in unpaid care work. In response, the CPO supports initiatives to promote formalization, empower women economically, and develop enterprises. Building on previous ILO work, the programme continues to contribute to policy progress in the care economy, enhance training systems, and strengthen institutions that support informal workers and MSMEs. Key beneficiaries include women and youth entrepreneurs, informal workers, MSMEs, and marginalized groups, such as persons with disabilities. The strategy is implemented in collaboration with national ministries and international development partners through initiatives like Decent Employment for Youth (DEY III), ILO ProSSCE-ASEAN, and South-South and Triangular Cooperation. By utilizing tools such as Know About Business, Community-Based Enterprise Development, and Start and Improve Your Business, the CPO promotes entrepreneurship and decent work, aiming for a more inclusive and resilient enterprise ecosystem that fosters formalization, job creation, and sustainable livelihoods."
