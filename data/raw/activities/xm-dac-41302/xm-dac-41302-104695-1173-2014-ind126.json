    "The strategy of the project is to provide support for a national dialogue-based country assessment to move towards the building of a nationally determined social protection floor and the extension of social protection in accordance with the two-dimensional strategy. The objective of this project is to support India in its efforts in building, expanding, extending or reorienting its social protection system using the social protection floor approach and the two-dimensional strategy for the extension of social protection. Special consideration will be given to the poor and most vulnerable populations. The project will also contribute to laying the foundation for a logical, coherent and viable long-term structure of national social protection systems in India. The project will focus in providing technical assistance to the national and state governments in formulating evidence based gender equitable policy options for building a national social protection floor through a process of social dialogue with broader participation of all stakeholders. This includes: (i) awareness raising/advocacy campaigns; (ii) assistance in the establishment of the required institutional framework(s) for policy development and coordination; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the constituents in the formulation of policy options. The project will utilize South-South cooperation for knowledge and information sharing. Immediate objective 1: A tripartite social dialogue mechanism is established at national/state levels for building a social protection floor Output 1.1 Awareness raising/advocacy campaigns at the national and state levels by the constituents Output 1.2 Inter-ministerial tripartite social protection floor task force established at national/state levels Output 1.3: South-south technical assistance provided to enhance knowledge on social services delivery Immediate objective 2: Evidence based policy options are developed identifying a country specific set of measures for building a social protection floor at national/state levels.
