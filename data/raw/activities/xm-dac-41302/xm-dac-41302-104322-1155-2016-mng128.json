    "This project is the second phase of the ILO/Japan Project to Promote and build unemployment insurance and employment services in ASEAN. The project is expected to contribute to the extension of social protection in ASEAN and Mongolia, by fostering know-how and South-South cooperation, as well as supporting countries, especially Mongolia, to develop policies, schemes and mechanisms for the implementation of a nationally defined social protection floor, in particular guarantees for the elderly and working age groups. The first component of the project will enhance capacities of governments and social partners in Mongolia and ASEAN, facilitate exchange of know-how and knowledge for the development and implementation of income security and employability measures for vulnerable groups. The second component will provide support to the government and social partners in Mongolia to design income security and employability measures for rural youth, as well as income security measures for the older people (herders, self-employed and informal economy workers) and improve integrated delivery of these policies."
