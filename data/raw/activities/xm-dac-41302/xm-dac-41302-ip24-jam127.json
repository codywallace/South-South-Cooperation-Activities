    "In this biennium, the ILO will support Jamaica's Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) in improving and implementing its national strategy to prevent and eradicate child labour. Jamaica's draft Country Acceleration Plan (CAP) aims to align with the Regional operational Programme on Child Labour (PRAETI) and SDG Target 8.7 by 2025. Jamaica, the only Caribbean country to implement the ILO's Child Labour Risk Identification Model (CLRISK), has requested ILO support to expand educational engagements into mid-level risk zones and to update the CLRISK model to incorporate pandemic effects and gender perspectives. Requests have also been made for digital transformation support for better data collection and analysis, evidence-based decision-making, and collaboration with key child protection partners for multi-stakeholder education and interventions.\n\nThe ILO will assist in enhancing labour inspection processes and technical capacities of inspectors, including the use of hand-held tablets and digital compliance forms. The ILO will provide technical expertise, facilitate capacity building,  and promote knowledge exchange through South-South Cooperation and sub-regional platforms. ILO will also support institutional strengthening and formalized cooperation between the MLSS and the Jamaica Household Workers Union (JHWU) including industrial relations training, development of an MoU focused on child labour and freedom of association, and public awareness campaigns. This initiative will benefit children, adolescents, and the broader community by improving child labour prevention and protection measures."
