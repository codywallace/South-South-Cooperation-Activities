    "The National Employment Agency (NEA) of Cambodia has conducted a skill anticipation survey applying the ILO approach, which has delivered key information to policy makers and relevant stakeholders to prepare for future needs of labour force. Through the ILO/SIDA partnership programme and ILO/China project on \"Strengthening Skill Development in Cambodia, Lao, and Myanmar through South-South and Triangular Cooperation\", and with support of the International Training Centre of the ILO, two members of the NEA staff  received e-training on the ILO approach and methodology to measure skill mismatches. The ILO also provided technical advice to NEA in designing the methodology and conducting the skill anticipation survey.",
    "Four TVET institutions in Cambodia (two public and two private) have increased capacity to undertake Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) assessments. As a result, the private institutionsbecame Assessment Centres, while the public institutions have applied for a certification. During on-the-job training, these institutions conducted RPL assessments for 157 young workers in Welding; Machining; Fruit and Vegetable Processing; Baking and Housekeeping occupations.\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT) has started its journey towards greening TVET in collaboration with the private sector. The MLVT has developed training curriculums on green skills competency standards of five occupations in two sectors (tourism/hospitality and construction). In addition, 12 representatives from public-private TVET actors, employers' and workers' organizations have improved their understanding of the role of skills development policies in advancing the sustainable transition to a greener future and improving the employability of women and men in emerging green industries.\n\nGovernment officials and social partners have improved their knowledge and capacity in digitalization of TVET programme and RPL; 18 officers have been trained on Digital TVET and other 36 TVET actors received a 8-week coaching programme on how to blend TVET and RPL. With support from Switzerland, China and Sweden, the ILO provided on-the-job training to the four TVET institutions on conducting the RPL assessments in light manufacturing and tourism/hospitality sectors. The International Training Center of the ILO designed and provided an online coaching programme in order to build the capacity of constituents in TVET digitalization and RPL."
