    "This programme supports the implementation of child labour (CL) priorities established by the Trinidad and Tobago National Steering Committee on Child Labour and aligns with the Regional Programme for Acceleration of Elimination of Child Labour (PRAETI). It addresses direct requests for technical assistance from the Ministry of Labour. The focus areas include finalizing a national Country Acceleration Plan, developing a national Child Labour policy, creating sectoral light and hazardous child labour lists, building capacity for technical officials, and improving processes for CL labour inspections and inter-agency collaboration.\n\nThe ILO will provide legal and technical advisory services, technical training through fellowships and workshops, and facilitate South-South Cooperation for knowledge exchange. The ILO will also support the modernization and digitalization of labour administration, including data collection and analysis. The collaboration will benefit the Ministry of Labour, national coordinating agencies, and vulnerable groups by enhancing their capacity to address child labour issues effectively."
