    "Knowledge management plan 252. Component 4 of the project (Regional cooperation, learning and knowledge exchange) is closely aligned with the framework of the Critical Forest Biomes (CBF) Mesoamerica Program which is aimed at promoting South-South learning and exchange, fostering cooperation and synthesizing experiences. The project will take advantage of knowledge management events sponsored by the Regional Platform of the Mesoamerican Critical Forest Biomes Program (peer learning, training, field visits, mentoring, etc.) regarding the protection and management of CFBs, and will make use of knowledge products on best practices and program documents and publications, including knowledge management on forest landscape governance, biodiversity monitoring, effective PA management, other effective conservation measures (OEMC), good practices in livestock and agriculture sustainable (pressure reduction), fire management associated with agricultural practices.  253. The project team, the executing agency, the Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Descendants and key actors will be able to benefit from the training offered through the Program on topics of relevance to management and implementation. Training and exchange events are contemplated of knowledge on key topics in a context of change such as: change and resistance to change; self-knowledge and emotional management, strategic and operational planning, change management and focus on service to the population. In addition, they will use tools developed by the Program such as validation practices, exchange of experiences and demonstration of good productive and environmental practices and may request guidance to access new financial opportunities, to promote the participation of the Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Descendants and the private sector, for the production of communication material. Nicaragua will participate in the Steering Committee of the Mesoamerican Program and its annual meetings. 254. The knowledge management program will also include a communication plan that will serve to report progress and share the experience of the project, its general strategy, advances in the livestock and cocoa chains and in the restoration of degraded landscapes. Thus, the knowledge management program will serve to make decisions and strengthen policies and the governance system in order to underpin the processes developed and the lessons learned in the long term. 255. Activities that contemplate knowledge management are also present in components 1 (training on the subject of governance and management of SINIA decentralized offices), component 2 (training for the restoration and conservation of CFBs, water management and monitoring comment), and component 3 (publicize the environmental incentives mechanism). 256.Finally, the knowledge management system will be linked to the Project Monitoring and Evaluation System in order to contribute to the construction of monitoring mechanisms of the National and Regional System of Protected Areas.Table 7: KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PLAN – DETAILED ACTIVITIES AND BUDGET               Component            Activities            US$    Budget                 Component 1.

Communication Strategy257. The project will develop a communication plan that will allow interested parties to know the efforts being made by the Governments of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN) in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change in accordance with the guidelines and commitments acquired in the Paris Agreement. It will also provide the interested parties (state institutions) with the purpose and scope of the project, the duration of the activities proposed in the project, the social and environmental risks that may arise in the formulation, execution and closure of the project, the participation of interested parties and the means in which they can present complaints and claims. 258. This Social Communication Strategy is a tool that strengthens the process of participation, dialogue and consultation, highlighting values ??of care and protection of Mother Earth; raising awareness of environmental and climate change problems in our country and shared responsibility for the sustainability of forests in harmony with Mother Earth. 259. Likewise, it is a tool to publicize the actions that are developed in the execution stage of the project \"Protection and conservation of forests of global importance located in the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve and the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve\", contributing to the knowledge and assessment of strategic options.260.It is guided by the provisions of ILO Convention No. 169, referring to the restitution of the right of indigenous peoples to free and informed prior consultation; with the Law of Autonomy of the Regions of the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua (Law No. 28), which in its article 8, paragraph 1 indicates the right of the Autonomous Regions to: “Participate effectively in the preparation and execution of plans and programs of national development in its region, in order to harmonize them with the interests of the Communities of the Atlantic Coast\", and promotes participation in a leading way in development, through direct presence and alliance policies.Scope and target audience of the Communication Strategy  261. The Communication Strategy is national in nature, with emphasis on the Autonomous Regions of the Caribbean Coast. The Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua comprises two Autonomous regions, the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast and the Autonomous Region of the South Caribbean Coast, which comprise 56% of the national territory and house 13% of the total population. The strategy will be implemented in these two Autonomous Regions, in the Alto Wangki y Bocay (AWB) and in the municipalities of the buffer zones. 262. Project internveniton areas are multiethnic, multilingual and pluricultural regions, in which different Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Descendants communities live: Mískitus, Mayagnas, Ulwas, Ramas, Garífunas and Creoles. 263. Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants are the first to face the consequences of climate change due to their dependence on the environment and its resources. Climate change exacerbates the difficulties they face, and constitutes a threat and danger to their survival. Indigenous peoples are essential to the sustainability of the numerous ecosystems of their lands and territories.264. The social communication plan target both local and national actors:-          Local actors: Indigenous communities, Afro-descendants, Regional Authorities, Indigenous Territorials, Producers, Ranchers, Cooperatives, Women and Youth Organizations, Local Environmental Organizations, Network of Alternative Communicators, media and Human Development Councils.-          National actors: Good Government institutions, external cooperation organizations, universities and the general public.265. The General objective of the social communication plan is to achieve a significant increase in public awareness, commitment and support for the long-term protection and conservation of globally important forests located in the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve and the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve.266.Specific objectives are to (i) Disseminate environmental messages about the actions promoted by GRUN, for the care and restoration of Mother Earth so that our population is informed and applies good environmental practices, particularly avoiding deforestation and forest degradation and (ii) to strengthen and disseminate values ??of love and care for Mother Earth, which promote actions against environmental problems and climate change and against the causes of deforestation and forest degradation.267. The implementation of the Communication Strategy will be based on different indicators:Indicator 1: Translation of printed materials and documents.-          Reproduction of printed material for capacity building.-          Translated all documents of regulatory instruments, ordinances and territorial plans.Indicator 2: All documents made official and published-          Publication of documents of regulatory instruments, ordinances and territorial plans.-          Publication for officialization of regulatory documents.Indicator 3: Materials for communication campaigns-          Communication materials designed-          Printed graphic materials to raise awareness about the care and conservation of forests.-          Plan communication campaign-          Distribution of communication materials in the regionsKey Messages268. These messages must be characterized by being short, simple and creative, disseminated in Spanish and translated into local languages ??such as: Creole, Miskitu and Mayagna in the case of the North and South Caribbean Coast Regions and the AWB special zone.Crosscutting269. Gender equality will be promoted, equal rights to participation of the protagonist communities, the ancestral values ??of love and care and protection of Mother Earth will be resumed, validating the work content and advertising pieces in such a way that the cultural traditions, languages ??and traditional ways of living and coexisting with nature.Budget270. For the implementation of the Communication Strategy of the Project “Protection and conservation of forests of global importance located in the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve and the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve”, there is a total amount of $208,500.00 USD.E.2 Economic benefits and rural employmentEconomic and Social Benefits resulting from the projectThe project design is oriented towards social and economic sustainability, contributing significantly in both areas:      Social      Sustainability: The project promotes the active participation of      stakeholders from the outset, involving institutional actors at the      national, regional, and territorial levels, as well as Indigenous      territorial governments, local communities, women, and the private sector.      This participatory approach ensures greater ownership of the project and      aligns activities with the benefits of all stakeholders involved.      Additionally, a capacity-building program is implemented that promotes the      inclusion and empowerment of Indigenous peoples, women, and youth,      ensuring generational continuity, a key aspect of social sustainability.  Economic      Sustainability: The project establishes innovative economic models for the      conservation and restoration of forests in Protected Areas. It seeks to      create dialogue platforms between the public and private sectors to      consolidate strategies that facilitate interaction with the financial      sector and investors. This economic sustainability is fundamental to      improving the livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant      peoples in the areas of      intervention, allowing for the mobilization of resources from both the      public and private sectors                                                                                               [1] https://www.marena.gob.ni/Enderedd/wp-content/uploads/Fases/13.%20Estrategia%20Nacional%20ENDE.pdf"
