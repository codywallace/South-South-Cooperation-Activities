    "E.1 Knowledge management and Communication   131. Knowledge management approach and Communication strategy comprises component 4 of this project and are structured under two outputs: 4.1.1. Communication strategy developed and under implementation; 4.2.2. Knowledge management plan developed and implemented, including south-south cooperation activities.    Knowledge Management Plan   132. The Knowledge management plan will be transversal to all three main components of this project and will be implemented in two main approaches: An internal approach, referring to the knowledge generated by the project   activities and results; and an external approach, building on the knowledge already developed by local organizations, seeking to improve projects and synergistic actions impacts.    133. In the internal approach, the project team will document, store, analyze and publicize project results and the knowledge generated during activities implementation. In this sense, activities planned in the Knowledge management plan include publication of online and printed documents for publicizing and spreading project results and Knowledge generated and realization of seminars and workshops to share and discuss project findings with main partners and beneficiaries. These events include south-south cooperation activities with other projects supported by GEF targeting cocoa under the FOLUR programme (i.e., Nicaragua and Ivory Coast) and GEF-7 project in Venezuela. The team project will also seek to participate in events organized by partners to share results and findings, positioning the project as an important initiative in innovation and knowledge generation fields.  Also, the project will support innovation initiatives in agroforest management and cocoa value chain in partnership with local universities and promote environmental education weeks in schools, highlighting the importance of cabruca and producer's role for biodiversity conservation.   134. In the external approach, the project will work together with local stakeholders to overcome major barriers regarding knowledge management. The region has a rich set of organizations involved with research, development and innovation activities, such as universities, private companies and NGOs, as well as CEPLAC. Despite that, there’s a lack of knowledge integration and diffusion in a way that facilitates decision-making process by public authorities and private actors, supporting the territorial development planning based on actual data and information. The project will support the development of tools and platforms, in partnership with Social Observatory and Scientific and Technological Park to integrate, organize and share in accessible ways relevant data and information with main public and private stakeholders and with the society in general.   135. In Component 1, the knowledge management plan, including internal and external approach will support the decision-making process and regional planning in the scope of the governance system with actual and precise data and information. In component 2, the project will support tools and platforms for knowledge generation and sharing, will promote workshops for discussion and knowledge integration with main stakeholders regarding Biodiversity Conservation, Landscape Planning, Environmental Restoration and Payment for Environmental Services. Will also develop a landscape and biodiversity monitoring systems that will help the design of public policies and strategic actions. Also, the project will support the capacitation and training of young people in actions such as “Biodiversity monitoring System implementation” and “Community environmental agents’’. In component 3, the project will work with partners to build on and improve the knowledge related to agroforestry management practices, training technicians and producers, and improving cabruca management systems. One of the strategies that will be implemented to raise technical knowledge available in the project region will be the “Cocoa School''. It's a hub of knowledge development that will offer continuous training programs to rural technicians and producer’s, that includes exchanges between producers to raise the knowledge related to better management practices.   136. The knowledge management plan will adopt gender sensitive actions, promoting workshops with women leadership to foster and improve women role in knowledge management and diffusion and women role in biodiversity and agrobiodiversity conservation and in cocoa value chain. The project will also adopt strategies to valorise and fully integrate local and traditional knowledge in the decision-making process, guaranteeing its participation in the governance system and other discussion forums implemented by the project. Also, the project will be implementing activities to document and safeguard local and traditional knowledge, in activities such as “Support and valorisation of traditional management practices through GIAHS patrimonialization and cabruca dynamic conservation plan elaboration” and as one of the main functions of the community environmental agents.

The project will directly benefit cocoa producers with a series of activities such as technical assistance, training and capacitation program, access to market, economic valorization of products and byproducts of cabruca systems through incentives to better production and processing practices and labeling and marketing strategies. Through this set of actions, the project seeks to revitalize cabruca systems and the cocoa value chain in the impacted region, contributing to regional sustainable economic development and positioning 141. Bahia State and Brazil as one of the biggest producers of sustainable cocoa in the world. To achieve this the project will support small and medium farmers, seeking to increase technical capacities, yields, product quality and access to better markets, fostering increase in income generation by rural activities in smallholders’ families, improving their livelihoods.     144. As mentioned in the sections above, the cabruca system contributes immensely to biodiversity conservation, climatic regulation, landscape connectivity and promotes ecosystem services such as water and soil protection and renovation in addition to its social, cultural and economic importance to the region, as will be more explored in “Annex B – Baseline Scenario and problem to be addressed” (please refer to the Annex B in the ProDoc word document). Nevertheless, the current state of cabruca economic unviability and producers’ vulnerability is one of the major drivers of productive areas transformation that leads to forest degradation and biodiversity loss. In this sense, strengthening and valorizing farmers’ role in biodiversity conservation by promoting the sustainable cocoa value chain is a key strategy to achieve global benefits linked to Tropical Forests and its biodiversity management and conservation, as well as promotion of ecosystem services. Yet, the revitalization of cocoa culture in the region is fundamental for rural succession and maintenance of families in rural areas, ensuring employment and income generation that attends to families demands and needs and fosters better life quality. The revitalization and valorization of the cocoa value chain promotes employment and decent work for rural people, especially for young people. The project will work closely with small and medium producers guaranteeing good work conditions in all activities related to the project. In this sense the project will contributes to Decent Rural Employment (DRE) in four pillars of DRE supported by FAO, as follows:   Pillar 1 – employment creation and enterprise development: Women and men small-scale producers supported in accessing markets and modern value chains.; agribusiness and marketing micro, small and medium enterprises supported in accessing markets, training, financial services and other productive assets; vocational and educational training programmes on technical and business skills for rural people supported; Capacities of national partners supported to collect and analyze age and disaggregated data on rural labor markets.   Pillar 2 – Social protection: occupational safety and health measures for the rural workforce adopted by promoting safer technology for small scale and commercial agriculture in extension programmes; working conditions improved in rural areas, including effective maternity protection and living wages in agriculture.     Pillar 3 – Standards and rights at work: Socially responsible agricultural production supported, specifically to reduce gender and age based discrimination; Child labour prevention and reduction in rural areas supported by tackling its root causes (poverty, lack of education) and providing livelihood alternatives to poor households; Compliance with national labour legislation promoted in rural areas.   Pillar 4 – Governance and Social Dialogue: Countries supported in strengthening democratic organizations and networks of producers and workers, particularly in the informal rural food economy; Representation of the rural poor in social dialogue and policy dialogue through their organizations supported; Participation of rural poor in local decision-making and governance mechanisms supported; Rural women and youth groups empowered to be involved in these process from the initial steps; Synergies built between organizations, programmes, countries and producer-to-producer learning opportunities created."
