    "Reduce and eliminate UP-POPs (PCDD/Fs, HCB and PCNs) and Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) releases through the introduction of BAT/BEP in the Secondary Aluminum and Zinc production, and implementation of a life cycle management in Lead acid battery and  Lithiumn ion battery recycling in China.",
    "Note: Disbursement data provided is cumulative and covers disbursement made by the project Agency.",
    "The Global Environmental Benefits (GEB) of this project at the CEO Endorsement stage, are the same as presented at the PIF stage which is the positive impacts of UP-POPs reduction of 32.25 g TEQ to be achieved by the demonstration activities at two (2) and 322.50 g TEQ at 10-12 enterprises through the National Replication Programme, for a total of 354.75 g TEQ UP-POPs reduction for a two-year operation period.  In addition to UP-POPs and BFRs reductions, the project will promote the wider application of the technologies for UP-POPs reduction, such as the promotion of energy-saving measures to promote the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the demonstration enterprises and the selected industries. The success of circular economy will also count on the effective cooperation by both public and private partnership where government should create enabling policy environment and enterprises can generate economic values. Value chain analysis and redesign is needed for the reconstruction of the cooperation of different enterprises to ensure the circular economy will contribute to sustainable development, environmental protection and economic development.  The project will also be demonstrative for other developed and developing countries. With the leading developed countries promise to ban petrol powered vehicles and promote electrical vehicles, China’s pioneering demonstration on lithium and lead battery recycling and their green re-production will provide replicative models.   China’s ban of importing scrap metals also influences global dynamics and makes major exporters in Europe and America reship them scrap metals to South-eastern Asia, where facilities and capacities on smelting and processing those secondary metals are very limited. The good practice, technologies and management experience generated from this project will be disseminated and shared with South-eastern Asian countries to minimize chemicals emissions and maximize resources recycling.  Additional economic and social benefits that will be brought on by this project will include:    Enhanced policy, regulatory, monitoring and analysis frameworks,      to safeguard human health and the environment.   Reduced health impact from the exposure to UP-POPs      emissions by the workers in the work place, at the manufacturing      enterprises and recycling facilities.  Avoid potential loss of jobs for the low skilled workers      with socioeconomic assessment that will be carried out to evaluate this      risk, and if necessary, a gender responsive livelihoods restoration plan      will be prepared and implemented to support the workers either through      raising their capacity to be able to operate the established devices or      finding them other suitable positions with the enterprises.  National replication plan to transfer knowledge and      experience that leads to the wider application of technologies for UP-POPs      reduction at manufacturing and recycling facilities.  Increase in awareness on UP-POPs emission and hazardous      waste by the general public on sound management of chemicals. The project      estimates to increase awareness of 2,000 direct beneficiaries and      1,000,000 indirect beneficiaries.   Knowledge and experience gained, as well as lessons learned will not only be used with the National Replication Programme, but will also be shared with countries in the region or any interested Parties using the awareness raising/engagement and data gathering platform, e.g. UNDP platform for South-South cooperation to exchange international experience in import and export management, project experiences, knowledge and lessons learned will be shared nationwide and through UNDP’s global networks."
