    "The project aims to accelerate progress towards the global level impact of climate stability, living in harmony with nature and a pollution free planet through improved environmental governance via the implementation of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). The project focuses on enhanced policy coherence, synergies, and cooperation between the MEAs globally and at national level, between their secretariats, and South-South and triangular cooperation among Parties to the MEAs. The UNEP Mid-Term Strategy 2022 – 2025 (MTS) recognises the MEAs are central to its achievement and that lack of coherent and synergistic implementation characterised by the absence of a ‘whole of government approach’ at the national level, is a significant factor impeding current progress. The project justification, intervention strategy and activities are based on well-founded needs and priorities as expressed by national governments who are Parties to the MEAs, clear instructions from UNEA and from the governing bodies of the biodiversity-related MEAs and the MEAs in the chemicals and waste cluster, calling for more integration, as well as from extensive feedback from stakeholders. UNEP has unique strengths in this area that include its universal mandate, convening power among the MEAs and their Parties, and a well-established track recorded competence in the subject area. \nThe MEAs being legally binding, set the minimum requirements for international environmental governance, including on transboundary matters and matters beyond national jurisdiction. The MEAs collectively reflect most of the objectives and work areas of UNEP. By improving coherence and synergy in their implementation, the project, therefore, ultimately contributes across the MTS and the Programme of Work (PoW) outcomes that deliver on the global impact. Similarly, the project delivers on the environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Targets. \nThe project is aligned with and contributes to the UNEP Medium-Term Strategy 2022 – 2025 and its Programme of Work and Outcomes chiefly via the Theory of Change and Logframe of the Environmental Governance Subprogramme, the dominant subprogramme under which the project is administered, and its impacts monitored. Hence, the Strategic Impacts are the UNEP objectives of climate stability, living in harmony with nature and a pollution free planet. \nThe project focuses on policy coherence and strong policy, legal and institutional frameworks to increasingly achieve environmental goals in the context of sustainable development consistent with the foundational impact of the Environmental Governance Subprogramme. The project is implemented through two main Outcomes. The First Outcome is focused on the global synergies agenda, namely,  ‘UNEA and MEA governing bodies and the UN system increasingly adopt and provide guidance for coherent and synergistic implementation of international environmental commitments’;  Outputs contributing to this are: support to increased knowledge on coherence, synergy and cooperation among and between the climate, land, biodiversity and chemicals and waste MEAs and their secretariats,  and with UNEA; and,  Increased support from UN Agencies and UN country teams for policy coherence regarding the MEAs for sustainable development, including support to EMG and UN Common Approach on Biodiversity. The Second Outcome is focused on national synergies support, ‘Increased gender balanced individual and institutional capacity at national level for the coherent and synergistic implementation of the MEAs’.  Outputs contributing to this are: support for capacity building for gender considerations regarding enhanced coordination, cooperation and synergies for the coherent implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and their associated national strategies and action plans; improved information,  knowledge management and tools – including national reporting to the MEAs, interoperability of information systems among the MEAs and integration of MEA related information into national sustainable development planning; coherence and synergies among the MEAs integrated into the follow-up actions for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and Strategic Approach and sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020; and, communication and awareness raising for coherence and synergies among the MEAs. The two outcomes contribute respectively to the two outcomes of the Environmental Governance Subprogramme - common and integrated approaches to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and enhanced institutional capacities to achieve international agreed environmental goals. \nThe project builds on lessons learned and previous successful interventions by UNEP in this area including two previous projects on promoting synergies and coherent implementation of the  MEAs. The current project advances"
