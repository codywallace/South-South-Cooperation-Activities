    "In 2015, Heads of State and Government committed to the principles of the Agenda for Sustainable Development and realizing its goals by 2030. They also adopted a new climate change agreement in Paris in December that will contribute to the achievement of these goals. It is within this context, that the Secretary-General’s Climate Change Support Team, located within the Executive Office of the Secretary-General, requests financial support that enables the UN Secretary-General to maintain and expand his global leadership on climate change in four key areas:  1) High-level political mobilization including follow-up to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference; 2) Scaled-up climate action;  3) South-South cooperation on climate change; and 4) UN system wide coherence and coordination in support of implementation of the PA and the 2030 Agenda."
