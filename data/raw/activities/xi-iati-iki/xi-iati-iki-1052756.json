    "Peatlands are found almost everywhere, but are increasingly being overexploited. The project therefore highlights the status and importance of peatlands and emphasises the implementation of commitments to climate action. A global assessment of peatlands, complemented by thematic hotspot atlases and a knowledge platform, improves the accessibility of knowledge and data. The project also identifies gaps in global and national policy and develops guidelines for the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of peatlands and their contribution to climate protection. Partners share and further develop strategies and approaches to close the gaps and address peatland loss and degradation through innovation, lessons learnt and exchange in South-South cooperation. The project also supports Partner Countries in data collection, capacity building, policies and guidelines on peatlands."
