    "The Democratic Republic of Congo is contaminated with landmines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) as a result of the First and Second Congo Wars (1996-97 and 1998-2003 respectively), as well as subsequent localised conflicts between the DRC Government and various rebel groups. Although the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu, where conflict is still ongoing to the present day, were the most significantly affected by these conflicts, all eleven provinces of the country were contaminated. The former province of Equateur is the most contaminated province in DRC, and North Ubangi is the most contaminated district in Equateur, as shown by a National Landmine Contamination Survey (NLCS) conducted in 2013. In April 2014, the DRC was able to report that 130 SHAs affected by mines remained in eight provinces (Equateur, Kasaï Occidental, Kasaï Oriental, Maniema, North Kivu, Katanga, Province Orientale, and South Kivu) covering an estimated 1.8km2, more than half of which was located in Equateur and Katanga provinces. These estimations were made on the basis of the results of a nine-month-long National Landmines Contamination Survey (NLCS) launched in March 2013 by UNMAS to determine the full extent of mine and cluster munition contamination across the country. Once the survey was completed, DRC used the results as the basis for its second Article 5 deadline extension request, which was submitted in April 2014. In June 2014, states parties to the APMBC granted DRC a six-year extension to complete Anti-Personnel mine clearance on its territory by 1 January 2021. However, MAG and other mine action operators are confident that DRC can achieve Article 5 compliance in less than two years with adequate support. Completion of clearance in DRC will have a significant impact on the mine action sector as a whole and will serve as an example for other countries of how to achieve treaty compliance using quality Non-Technical Survey. Given the prospect of completion, MAG will work in partnership with GICHD to ensure that the national authorities have the capacity to implement strategies and policies associated with completion, as well as the technical capacity to deal with residual contamination."

    "From the first few months of being operational in Nord-Ubangi, MAG has learnt that the contamination present in certain areas are residue of a conflict period that have resulted from the use of readily available weapons and ammunition. Much ERW has been found in abandoned, heavily forested land, rather than in key infrastructural or public service places, or locations that are frequently used by the population. This context has been reflected in the baseline figures, and the original anticipated figures have been adjusted accordingly. According to initial work, agricultural lands forms the majority of land that has been subjected to contamination. To this end 90% of land release is anticipated to be used for this purpose. With 10% allocated to infrastructure.",
    "MAG will take a 10% survey rate throughout the MRE sessions and  land release direct beneficiaries From the response rate number, a 40% positive response rate has been projected, of which the final numbers have been spread over the milestones according to project implementation planning in-country. The positive response rate projection is based on MAG internal expertise and experience. As explained in the context above many ERW are found in places where it does not seemingly or necessarily seem to obstruct livelihoods. Additionally, as preliminary results have indicated, the response rate to the questions related to livelihoods is exceedingly low compared to expectations",
    "MAG will take a 10% survey rate throughout the MRE sessions and land release direct beneficiaries. From the response rate number, a 15% positive response rate has been projected, of which the final numbers have been spread over the milestones according to project implementation planning in-country. The positive response rate projection is based on MAG internal expertise and experience. As explained in the context above many ERW are found in places where it does not seemingly or necessarily seem to impact or obstruct access to services.",
    "A key contextual factor that influences the baseline figures for DRC significantly is the demographics of the province. As there are no real population figures to rely on in-province, the original prediction figures had been based on national statistics, which are not corresponding to the sex/age-disaggregated figures that MAG is currently finding trough the activities of the project. For example, according to preliminary results, men and boys are quicker to respond to surveys when asked, and are generally more present at our sensitization sessions. Therefore, to reflect the reality of the situation in the provinces slightly better, for the purposes of this baseline, the sex/age-disaggregation (SADD) figures have been adjusted accordingly to the following:o 35% meno 30% womeno 25% boyso 10% girlsMAG has taken a 10% survey rate baseline figures relating to the indicators of Outcome 1. This percentage has thereafter been applied to each beneficiary category that the outcome indicators have referred to.",

    "The number of people trained was largely in line with anticipations, the focal points trained are selected for their prominence in their respective communities.",
    "The number of people trained as focal points is lower due to the fact that focal points are specifically trained in the communities of contaminated areas. As the teams were operating in more urbanised envrionments with concentrated populations, the amount of focal points is lower, as there is not such a distance between each focal point, as compared to rural village commuinities for example.",

    "Due to the administrative issues resulting from the renewal of various accreditations required by the NMAA combined with an unexpected replacement of field managers, operations were delayed in October and November and consequently, MAG did not achieve the targeted amount of people trained for this quarter. However, it is anticipated that this will be compensated in the forthcoming quarter. To this end, MAG intends to overachieve in the forthcoming quarter to ensure that targets are met. During the suspended time, MAG ensured that important and necessary refresher training and vehicle maintenance were carried out.",
    "The shortfall in the target represents the low population density of the area of operations. The operations throughout the no-cost extension period should help MAG improve on these results.",

    "The releatively low output of beneficiaries in the first 3 months of operations is explained due to the fact that the majority of ERWs reported in the areas of operation, were found in abandoned, heavily forested land, rather than in key infrastructural or public service places, or locations that are frequently used by the population.

    "During the month of October 2016, information was passed to MAG by the Deputy Governor of Nord Ubangi in relation to a known mine on a key supply road frequented by heavy goods vehicles road located 105 km west of Gbadolite in Mbwasenge village (Bosinga Territory) midway between Gbadolite and Bosinga. With this information MAG proceeded to deploy a multi task team to investigate the reported danger. Upon arrival the MTT identified the mine as a Soviet anti-vehicle (AV) mine (TM 62). The TM 62 is reported to have been laid during the 1998/1999 period. The local population had noted the mine, and for over fifteen years had diverted traffic from the main road, by placing logs around it. The mine was located in the centre of the village on the main route. To combat the threat, the MTT held meetings with the affected population to explain the threat and the process of removal. Once evacuation had taken place and safe distances were implemented, clearance work commenced. The team conducted the clearance by establishing a perimeter around the hazardous area and then proceeded to manually clear the mine. Once located the mine was destroyed in-situ. The impact of the work is that many villagers had previously been located within the blast radius of the mine should it have detonated and a mine of this size would likely lead cause many casualties. Furthermore, the route is used frequently by heavy vehicles carrying important supplies which are key to socioeconomic development as well as by humanitarian and development organisations. The presence of the mine had additionally caused the road to become distorted leading to vehicles detouring over the property of the villagers.",

    "The high number of MRE sessions conducted is due to the fact that a focus was put on sensitizing schools. As classroom size was large,  multiple sessions were held for the same schools. Furthermore,  since there is next to no NGO/foreign presence in those communities and populations were initially skeptical of MAG being there, the CL team made extra efforts to explain and sensitize the local population.",

    "This quarter was more productive than anticipated due to the weather being better than thought. Usually this is the wet season which inhibits clearance activities. As the teams progressed through the respective polygons the vegetation became better for clearance activities. Likewise, as  the teams moved from jungle to savannah, this meant that ground preparation became easier. There was no pattern to the items (ERW) found and the items were spread over a large areas for both technical teams.",
    "Against the projection, the quarter was less productive than anticipated in part due to the wet season taking place for much of the reporting period. The rain inhibited work, as it impairs the effectiveness of the detectors. The rain also affected certain access roads, as these are small unpaved tracks in some cases leading to rather remote areas. Much of the terrain is covered in dense jungle, which slows clearance activities as the vegetation requires removal. Similarly to the previous quarter the items found were scattered over a large area, with no discernible pattern.",
    "With regards to this quarter, both technical teams embarked on a period of leave. This explains the lower than anticipated outputs for this period. The outputs of m2 cleared relate to an ongoing task in Zongo, Sud Ubangi province.",

    "Activities  resumed  at the end of January after the Christmas standdown period. Administrative processes to regroup the teams seconded from the NMAA took time, as teams were obliged to wait for their task orders, sometimes more than week.  In January and the begining of February, teams terminated the area of Comuele and moved in February in Dongo area, still within the Kungu territory. The underachievement against this measure is expected to be compensated for during the no-cost extension period until the end of August. (Please note: the figure has been updated to reflect clearance in Ewanzombo that was not included in the original figure)",
    "During this quarter, our teams managed to record good results, as an example they cleared more than the double the land compared to the previous quarter. MAG produced this results despite several challenges, including delayed tasking orders that are out of the control of MAG. Second, as detailed in the previous quarter, our teams operated in large areas with low population density and weak road infrastructures. In North Ubangi, CLT1 worked in Businga  and Mobai Mbongo territories, and MTT1 worked in Businga. In South Ubangi, CLT2 and MTT2 worked in Kungu and Bujala.As the activities this quarter were the result of a no-cost extension, no targets were set.",
    "During this quarter, MAG's Multi Task Team worked for the first half of July in North and South Ubangi before demobilizing.

    "Due to the administrative issues resulting from the renewal of various accreditations required by the NMAA combined with an unexpected replacement of field managers, operations were delayed in October and November and consequently MAG did not conduct cancellation through NTS during this quarter.",
    "As  explained in the previous quarter, the Community Liaison teams were able to work efficiently and recorded impressive results. The overachievement has allowed MAG to compensate for the small underachivement of the Year One target. Please note: the figure has been updated to reflect cancellation in Mwaningala that had not previously been reported.",
    "Our teams managed to cancel a good amount of land during this quarter despite operating in an area where land had already been surveyed.",
    "The Community Liaison Team focussed on MRE during the quarter and did not perform any NTS. Nonetheless, the targets for NTS have been significantly exceeded during the quarter.",

    "The GICHD has conducted a national strategy stakeholder workshop in the DRC, from 22 to 25 August 2017. The workshop’s overall goal was to bring all major national and international stakeholders together to facilitate the development of DRC’s next national mine action strategy. The workshop had the following key objectives: Gain clarity on the extent, nature and impact of DRC’s mine/ERW problem • Identify key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced by the mine action programme • Gain a better understanding of risks facing the programme • Gain clarity on main stakeholders, their roles, influence, capacities and limitations • Clarify and agree on the programme’s overall vision, mission, goals and objectives • Define the programme’s desired results • Define how results will be monitored and reviewed All major national and international stakeholders, such as relevant ministries, NGOs, UNMAS, and CCLAM as the national coordination body, were represented and participated actively to the discussions. The main outputs of the workshop are: Stakeholder analysis and common understanding of the roles of each stakeholder • Analysis of strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the mine action programme • Analysis of various factors influencing the mine action programme • Agreed vision and mission statements • Agreed strategic goals with concrete objectives, each having baselines, indicators and targets • Definition of cross-cutting issues that will be mentioned in the strategy (e.g. information management, gender and diversity, etc.) The workshop allowed to collect all information required for drafting DRC’s national mine action strategy. The agreed timeline for the strategy is 2018-2019, i.e. two years. In accordance with the recommendations made by the GICHD the strategy limits its focus to three overall strategic goals: • Management of explosive risks – with a focus on reaching APMBC Article 5 completion • Advocacy • Management of residual contamination In close collaboration with CCLAM focal points, the GICHD is currently drafting DRC’s 2018-2019 national strategy. CCLAM will circulate the draft strategy to all relevant stakeholders ahead of the strategy validation workshop, planned for 9-10 November in Kinshasa. Following its validation, CCLAM will submit the strategy to relevant government authorities for formal approval, expected to be finalised in early 2018",
