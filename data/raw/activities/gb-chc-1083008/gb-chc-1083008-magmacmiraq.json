    "Iraq has a long history of tension and violence, including both internal unrest and conflict with external forces, which has resulted in the country being one of the most heavily contaminated in the world. Heavy fighting between the central government in Iraq and Kurds living in the northern part of the country in the 1970s, the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and the First and Second Gulf Wars (1990-91 and 2003 respectively), have all left their mark, with the country currently struggling to cope with the aftermath. Fractured throughout the past decade, the conflict situation in Iraq has been particularly acute since the beginning of the war in Syria, reaching crisis point in 2014 when ISIS forces took control of large parts of the country. Today battles still rage in many regions of Iraq, killing hundreds, provoking mass displacements of people, and causing untold damage to homes and infrastructure. The contamination context in Iraq is complex as a result of the series of conflicts outlined above. Legacy contamination from tactical minefields remains along international borders with Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, as well as internally along the former ‘Green Line’ between the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KR-I) and central/south Iraq. Latest estimates put total confirmed and suspected landmine contamination in Iraq at 1,604km2 across 3620 suspected or Confirmed Hazardous Areas. In addition, an estimated 236km² remain contaminated with cluster munitions in the centre and south of the country. More recently, contamination from both conventional and improvised ERW, landmines and booby traps has been on the increase, due to heavy fighting between ISIS and government forces. Due to the recent nature of this fighting, the full scale and scope of this contamination is, unknown. Under this planned project, clearance activities will be carried out in both legacy-contaminated and newly-contaminated areas, with a particular focus on Sulymaniya, Diyala, Kirkuk and Ninewa governorates. According to latest statistics 60% (179 km²) of remaining minefields in KR-I are in Sulymaniya governorate, and a further 52km² are in the governorates of Diyala and Kirkuk. A significant number of cluster munitions contaminated areas remain, particularly in Kirkuk governorate, although a comprehensive survey to determine the full scale and scope of cluster munitions contamination has not been conducted. Following ISIS presence in Diyala, Kirkuk and Ninewa governorates in the past two years, contamination from both conventional and improvised mines and other ERW has been widespread."

    "MAG will take a 10% survey rate throughout the MRE sessions. From the response rate number, a 75% positive response rate has been projected of which the final numbers have been spread over the milestones according to project implementation planning in-country. the response rate projection is based on MAG's internal expertise and experience. The programme will be unable to conduct a thorough baseline prior to beginning work on the assigned tasks. This is due to a number of reasons related to the volatile security situation in South Sudan. At proposal stage, MAG was preparing to work in the Equatoria states but following the outbreak of violence that from Juba spread across the country in July 2016, MAG has been re-tasked to alternative locations as it was no longer safe to deploy demining teams to the original selected areas. The change of geographical locations has led to a number of issues. For example: although it is now increasingly clear that for the remainder of 2017 our teams will be mostly working on two BAC sites, MAG cannot predict the type of contamination that our teams will be clearing from 2018 onwards. Because the security situation changes and UNMAS, the tasking authority in South Sudan, is not able to give advance notice of where they will be assigning our teams, we are also unable to carry out meaningful baseline assessments. This means that the calculations for beneficiaries numbers and square meters of land released, have been calculated based on MAG's experience in-country and on assessments we have carried out in the past. For these reasons, it is possible that the programme's projection of target outputs may display some discrepancies with actual outputs.",

    "Given the focus on BAC tasks this quarter, MAG has been able to significantly exceed the Q1 land clearance target.",
    "The underperformance in Q2 was due to bad weather conditions in April and May, less clearance at BAC tasks, and a limited number of working days in June. However, the outputs are still on track towards reaching the overall project targets.",
    "In this quarter no clearance was done on BAC tasks, during which usually large amounts of land can be cleared at a relatively rapid pace. Instead, clearance teams continued to be working on legacy minefields that are mostly situated in challenging, steep terrain for deminers to work. Furthermore, the teams worked on the high-threat areas of some minefields where they found and removed a large number of mines (142), which slowed the progress in terms of total squared meters land cleared.",

    "During the reporting period, MAG deployed two mine action teams from its base in Chamchamal for the full three months. The teams worked across nine tasks in Sulyumaniyah and Kirkuk governorates, all of which were minefields surrounding five different villages. Clearance activities during this quarter have been impacted by poor weather, which has prevented the deployment of teams on a number of days. The dutch funded capacity has also focused on minefield clearance during this quarter, which is a more time consuming activity than BAC. As detailed in MAG's 2019, an additional 12 team months of clearance activities will be supported over the project period. As none of this capacity has been deployed during this quarter, outputs can be expected to increase in the subsequent months.",
    "In this reporting period, two MATs were deployed from MAG's base in Chamchamal. The teams worked on six tasks in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk governorates on legacy minefields around four villages. The MATs completed two minefield tasks in Sulaymaniyah this quarter. Following heavy rainfall in the previous quarter, there was significant vegetation growth. Deminers needed to clear vegetation in order to safely continue search. The teams suspended operations and completed refresher trainings during the planned Eid al-Fitr stand down period. In June 2019, both MATs worked on the BAC task described below for several days. As noted in the last quarterly report, an additional 12 team months of clearance activities will be supported over the project period. The additional months will be allocated in the coming quarters, so it is expected that clearance outputs will increase.",

    "Four MATs deployed in Q4 for a total of eight MAT months. The MATs worked in six villages ih Dohuk, Sulaymaniyah, and Kirkuk governorates. The Dutch-supported teams completed two minefield tasks in Sulaymaniyah governorate. The teams primarily worked in steep, rocky areas with high vegetation over the reporting period, which slowed progress. The teams in Dohuk focused on technical survey in Q4. Despite these challenges, Dutch-supported teams reached the clearance target for the year, when factoring in clearance on the BAC task outlined in Q2.",
    "In Q1 of 2020, two MATs deployed from MAG's base in Chamchamal to two tasks in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk governorates and two MATs deployed to three tasks in Dohuk governorate, for a total of 12 MAT months. The task areas are primarily used for agriculture and grazing livestock by the surrounding communities. Clearance activities in Q1 were hindered by poor weather in January, which resulted in the loss of a significant number of working hours. On 2 March 2020, all operations in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk were suspended, as Iraq's earliest cases of COVID-19 were reported in the area. Movements between governorates and strict lockdowns were put in place by the KRG. In response, operations in Dohuk were also suspended in the second week of March. Despite these challenges, Dutch-funded clearance teams made strong progress against land release targets in the weeks that they were able to deploy.",
