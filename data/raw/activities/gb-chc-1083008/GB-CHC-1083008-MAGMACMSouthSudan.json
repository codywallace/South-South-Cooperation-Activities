    "South Sudan’s history is characterised by two civil wars, spanning from 1962-1978 and 1982-2002 respectively, between the ruling Northern government and separatist movements from the South. During the twenty two years of conflict Anti-Tank (AT) and Anti-Personnel (AP) mines were laid and cluster munitions were dropped. Incorporating operational learning from previous mine action activities in South Sudan, MAG has shifted its approach to dealing with contamination in Greater Equatoria from EOD-focused operations to increased BAC and minefield clearance, conducted using Community Liaison (CL) and Mine Action Teams (MAT) as part of an integrated land release approach. This approach maximises Non Technical Survey, Technical Survey and clearance as methods to release land in an efficient and cost-effective manner, with the former conducted by CL teams, the latter two by the MATs. MAG will conduct targeted and efficient clearance of landmines and cluster munitions contaminated areas in mostly hard to reach areas in Eastern Equatoria. The most immediate outcome of MAG’s activities in this project will be a reduction in risks to personal safety for at-risk target groups and those who are exposed to the threat of landmines and other ERW. By adopting a two-pronged approach including a combination of high priority land release and RE delivery to mine affected communities, the project will contribute to an increased feeling of safety among the target communities."

At proposal stage, MAG was preparing to work in the Equatoria states but following the outbreak of violence that from Juba spread across the country in July 2016, MAG has been re-tasked to alternative locations as it was no longer safe to deploy demining teams to the original selected areas. The change of geographical locations has led to a number of issues. For example: although it is now increasingly clear that for the remainder of 2017 our teams will be mostly working on two BAC sites, MAG cannot predict the type of contamination that our teams will be clearing from 2018 onwards. Because the security situation changes and UNMAS, the tasking authority in South Sudan, is not able to give us advance notice of where they will be assigning our teams, we are also unable to carry out meaningful baseline assessments. This means that the calculations for beneficiaries numbers and square meters of land released, have been calculated based on the experience in-country and on assessments MAG has carried out in the past. For these reasons, it is possible that the projection of target outputs of the programme may display some discrepancies with actual outputs.",
    "We will take a 10% survey rate from househlds directly benefiting from land release activities. Average households (HH) in South Sudan are calculated as having six members and here we present sex and age disaggregated data (SADD) for the HHs our team will survey. By year 4, the team will have surveyed some 113 HHs -  an average of 28 HHs per year. From that survey, a 40% positive response rate has been projected.

    "MAG will take a 10% survey from amongst MRE sessions and land release direct beneficiaries. From the response rate number, a 75% positive response rate has been projected.  The positive response rate projection is based on the internal expertise and experience of MAG. MAG tailors its surveying according to each specific activity it conducts in this project. Therefore, MRE activities are monitored with pre- and post- impact surveys for the sessions, whilst land release beneficiaries are surveyed periodically, as the demining teams need time to clear the areas of contamination, and allow time for the beneficiaries to resettle into the decontaminated area.

    "The community liaison capacity integrated in this team has been very active since operations began on 22 May 2017, visiting over 15 communities and a primary school within a 50Km radius from the location of operations and delivering 89 sessions or 74% of the overall target in the first month adn half of operations. The positive result is attributable to the fact that the CL capacity has been able to visit communities that have not previously received risk education by our teams working in the area. The pace is likely to slow down between July and the end of the year as the team will have to travel further and further out to identify beneficiaries who have not been exposed to RE messaging. As the rain season intensify, it will also become harder for the team to drive on the dirt roads in the Tindilo area - where none of the roads are paved.  Over and above these RE sessions, the team had multiple meetings with the communities directly interested by clearance activities in order to prioritise clearance operations in  manners suitable to the community. The team also maintained relations with village elders and local authorities. During the 89 RE sessions, the team distributed some 2,141 informative leaflets carrying safety messages that the beneficiaries will go on to share within their communities and extended families.",
    "The community liaison team reached well above its targets in terms of RE sessions conducted in this reporting period. The team operated mainly in five Bomas: Dari, Jabor, Mokido, Jabari and Mundari Bura, focusing on at risk communities.  The team also had a number of liaison meetings with local leaders to maintain a good working relationships with the communities and to prioritize areas to be targeted for risk education. The team also visited a primary school and delivered 3 sessions to 39 boys, 38 girls and 3 teachers (all male). The team distributed 4,500 leaflets, furthermore, the team left 3 posters with the school.",
    "The  community Liaison team achieved it targets  in terms of RE sessions conducted and number of MRE beneficiries reached. The team operatated in the following communities: Pudukak, Bari, Mundari Bura, Akinuel, Toldping, Gumbiri, Nyadole, Tapari, Toloping, Tolomalat, Werio, Rajaf.                                                                                      The team also conducted Community Liaison meeting  to strengthen our working relaitionships with communities, to priotise at risk areas and  target groups at risk of mines/ERWS. The team distributed 2500 MRE Materials, leaflets and posters to disseminate risk messaging at home and in communial centres.",
    "During this reporting period, the community liaison team (CLT) operated in Yei from January to February 2018. In Yei, they operated within a 3km radius and due to security they were not able to operate outside of town. Primarily, operations took place in the communities around the Yei Airport and on the road to the airport.  The specific communities reached by the CLTs in the Yei area are Hai Mission, Kanjoro, Nakibo, Pakujo, Ronyi, Juroden, and Atende primary school. In March 2018 the CLT relocated to Terekeka County, where they reached the communities of Hai Armia, Jali, Lenkango, Lojur, Lokweni, Terekeka Hospital, Zeria, Ngamagu, and Tukoro primary school. The return to Terekeka state responded to unexpectedly high local demands over the course of a month. In total, the CLT conducted 75 mine risk education sessions.",
    "The community liaison team continued operations in Terekeka state. Operations were primarily in the communities throughout Terekeka county and on the road to Moni county, specifically the communities of: Tukuro, Isiro, Muduk, Jai, Goket, Masangong, Kogi, Jobem, and Lokweni cattle camp. In May 2018, the community liaison team spent two weeks in Tindilo county, where in addition to conducting a post-clearance impact assessment they also reached the areas of Peri, Ngalek, Sito, Potan, Matara, Kwongnatekek, Korukomagor and Longi. The 124 sessions reached a total of 2,568 beneficiaries, significantly exceeding quarterly targets for men and women, and slightly exceeding targets for children. The over achievement in targets was primarily a result of reaching new areas around Terekeka county where many people had not previously had any exposure to MRE while the rates for children did not experience the same degree of over achievement because all schools in the area of operations had been reached previously.",
    "The community liaison team that carries out MRE is currently based in Terekeka town. There, they have been able to reach the villages of Lokwene, Juba Bayak and Gondi. MRE sessions were given to groups of cattle herders, members of the host community, school children, people traveling and people who make charcoal. These people were targeted because they were next to a former military barrack and most of cattle keepers use the area for grazing . Lokwene primary school was targeted for MRE because children from the school had reported some UXO around the area. The slight underachivement is a result of the leave taken in July.",
    "Community liaison teams were operational during the months of October and November. Outputs were slightly affected by training and the security context. In December, the team took part in training led by MAG's Roving Community Liaison Manager prior to their scheduled holiday leave. In addition, during October, clashes between cattle keepers around Terekeka led the teams to stay in camp in Terekeka town. The team had also been threatened in Gondi. Young men had requested rides from the teams, which contravenes MAG's security procedures. When the teams refused, they were threatened. However, the Terekeka Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC; this government agency has oversight of NGOs operating in South Sudan) was able to resolve the dispute.These factors resulted in a very slight underperformance against MRE session targets. Nonetheless, the team was able to surpass total beneficiary targets for the quarter. During the quarter, the teams visited the communities of Lengkango, Lokweni cattle camp, Lokweni primary school, hai Melekia, Pakamafi, Daragor, Gondi, Worpiya cattle camp, Lopuja primary school, Patai, Kogi Primary school, Kor primary school, Pantiop and Gulumbi. These communities were targeted to do reports of potentially dangerous items in the villages. Cattle camps were also targeted as experience has shown that cattle keepers are among the highest risk groups (due to cultural factors that encourage risk taking, significant time spent moving in the bush, and a local tradition of using scrap metal (often explosive devises) to make bells and decorations for cattle).",
    "The team work in the villages of Nantiko, Yari, Kworonit, Aporong, Longa, Jongor East, Buranga,  North Dabaya all these under Terekeka states and in Terekeka county. These villages were targeted because there were reports of IDPs returning from the neighbouring counties. These returnees were returning to areas that MAG's team could not access during the wet season. As such, the team used the dry season to provide risk education. In March 2018, as a result of the number of teams operating in Terekeka and the number of sessions provided to the local communities, the team redeployed to Magwi. They performed risk education in Ayaci, Chamoni, Oyere Primary school and Lerua. The population density of Magwi is higher than in Terekeka and the higher elevation and greater distance from rivers reduces the extent by which communities are cut off during the rainy season. Magwi is heavily contaminated and therefore in need of MRE. The heavy contamination with UXO also increases the likelihood that the CL team will receive reports for explosive ordnance disposal in this area.",
    "The CL team had already begun the redeployment to Magwi town, in Magwi county in the previous quarter. This region is more densely populated than Terekeka state and it is also an important location due to the number of both recent and anticipated future returns. The denser population supported the overachievement with MRE sessions and beneficiaries. The area is also hillier and at a higher  elevation compared to Terekeka, with wet weather not seriously affecting operations as a result. However, due to the heavy rains and insecurity in some parts of Central Equatoria, a large number of mine action teams (both MAG and other operators) are now deployed to Magwi county at least temporarily for the wet season months. Thus, MAG anticipates that the number of sessions in the subsequent quarter will be lower than average. A major challenge is that the local community speaks Acholi, which is a less commonly spoken language and thus MAG does not have many Acholi speakers on staff. However, Juba Arabic and English are more commonly spoken and therefore the teams are able to find local interpreters to assist with communication if some of the RE session participants only speak Acholi. At other times, if all session participants agree, the session will be given in Juba Arabic or English. This quarter overlapped with the planting season, and therefore it can sometimes be difficult to find members of the community who are available for sessions--the teams try to adjust their daily schedules to conduct MRE when community members have time available.",
    "The community liaison team continued working in Magwi town, as in the previous quarter, and were not affected by road closures or extremely poor weather conditions. The team continued working in Magwi county, initially reaching a number of new communities with MRE. However, following the deployment of other teams to other parts of the county, its area of operations will likely be limited.",
    "Community-based EORE sessions were conducted in 15 bomas of Magwi county:  Lobure, Omeo, Kilio, Alia, Agoro, Lachari, Lobota, Lubure, Amee, Chama, Lobato, Amika, Palonganyi, Obbo, and Loudo. In addition 4 school-based session were held: 2 in Palonganyi primary school in Palonganyi boma, and 2 at Wisdom Primary school in Lobure.",
    "The community liaison team was deployed to Magwi town, a more densely populated town in Magwi county. On 11 March the team relocated to Tindilo with the operations team to support resurvey. On 19 March 2020, community EORE sessions were suspended at the recommendation of UNMAS and the NMAA. On 21 March 2020, MAG suspended its operations in South Sudan due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "No operations this quarter. All operations suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. Remobilisation of Dutch-funded team expected August 2020",
    "All MAG CL teams, including the Dutch-funded CL team conducted refresher training in July and began EORE in August; therefore there was only one month of operations instead of two as expected in the work plan. EORE was conducted on a house-to-house basis with a maximum of 6 participants. Therefore the number of beneficiaries reached is significantly lower than planned",

While such groups of people are at a higher risk for accidents, as they are less familiar with the area, the people who travel to the market are more likely to be adults (both men and women). As a result, the MRE targets for adults were overachieved, while fewer children attended MRE sessions than expected.",
    "Men are most likely to be involved in mine and ERW accidents. While MAG takes measures to ensure that men are included amongst MRE beneficiaries, men are often the most difficult group to reach. In this regard, the overachievement of male MRE recipients illustrates the steps MAG has taken to increase male MRE participation.",
    "The teams were able to make strong progress during the first quarter due to the dry season conditions. The CL team made a strong push to reach previously inaccessible communities during the months of January and February in Terekeka town.

    "After successful mobilisation, training and accreditation of the team, MAG began operations in Tindilo payam on 22 May 2017. Since that date to 30 June 2017, the team has  largely been engaged in Battle Area Clearance (BAC) of a cluster munition strike site. Despite the heavy rains typical of the wet season in South Sudan and the heavy metal contamination of the site, the team has made steady progress on this task, clearing 38,581m2 of land or nearly 76% of the target set until September 2017. The target for the reporting period has been exceeded by more than 100% and this helps MAG make up for the delayed start of operations following the outbreak of violence in July 2016. The BAC site on which MAG has been tasked presents thick vegetation but it is the third BAC site MAG works on in Tindilo and many lessons have been learnt on previous sites to speed up ground prep.  MAG foresees that the current target will be met as the team steadily achieves clearance on this densely contaminated site.",
    "Since July the team has continued with battle area clearance (BAC) of a cluster munition strike situated in and around the village of Dengele, some 8km west of Tindilo village. Even though operations were hindered by heavy rains and floods, especially during the month of September, the team achieved very good outputs. To speed up ground preparation, MAG has purchased petrol driven bush cutters that make the removal of vegetation prior to clearance much faster.",
    "Since September the team has continued with battle area clearance (BAC) of a cluster munition strike situated in and around the village of Dengele, some 8km west of Tindilo village. The rainy seasaon subsided in November easing access to the site and to and from Juba. Lower ouputs for this quarter are due to the fact that in December the team carried out four spot tasks but not clearance operations as it prepared for Christmas stand-down.",
    "Team re-mobilized in mid-January following the planned Christmas stand-down. Working in the Tindilo area, the multi-task team (MTT) cleared 850 square meters of minefields and conducted 82,034 square meters of subsurface battle area clearance. Good weather during the peak of the dry-season allowed for impressive targets, exceeding clearance amounts for the previous three quarters of the contract term.",
    "Teams continued working on the tasks in Konyuki outside of Tindilo. The multi-tasks team (MTT) cleared 93,875 square meters of subsurface battle area. Early rains subsided into an a mild early rainy season period that did not directly hinder operations. However, increased vegetation growth following the start of the rains did slow clearance slightly late in the quarter. Nonetheless, subsurface BAC outputs were strong and exceeded those of the previous quarter.",
    "During July, the team was on regularly scheduled leave, which was followed by a period of refresher training (per normal standard operating procedures). In addition, the team has been deployed to a new site in Sitto. As this is the peak of the rainy season, and due to the geography of the area, operations in Sito lost a number of days to rain (16 whole days in August and September, as well as some days that did not reach full productivity due to heavy showers). Dense scrubland and fast-growing vegetation in this hazardous area required a significant amount of time for ground preparation as well.",
    "Teams continued working on the tasks in Sito, 12km south of Tindilo. The multi-tasks team (MTT) cleared 113,900 square meters of cluster munition subsurface battle area. The team has now moved away from the very heavy metallic ground encountered over the last quarter that was restricting clearance progress. Crops have been harvested over this area, which will also aid clearance as vegetation has been removed. Large areas of vegetation have also been burnt. Outputs were good this quarter and are expected to increase as the team progresses next year.",
    "The team continued to work in Sitto village. Outputs have been good, although contamination in this part of the hazardous area is not dense and therefore a low number of items have been found and removed. Although some parts of the hazardous are  closer to village, and therefore have higher metal contamination, overall ground conditions were good due to lower levels of mineralisation than had been encountered in other parts of Sitto boma. As operations progressed into March the team began to encounter mineralised soil once again, requiring the use of a different setting on the large loop detector. As the operations from January took plan in the dry season, there is limited vegetation on the task helping operations advance quickly.",
    "Outputs during the first two months of the quarter were strong and in line with previous months. In May, the team cleared 53,750m2, making it the second highest performing month in the past year. Throughout the reporting period, the team has been slowed by periodic reports of IO movements near to or in the area of operations. Because of these movements the team was sometimes confined to camp. During the quarter, the security manager conducted a visit and assessment of Tindilo and determined that, while these movements required monitoring, they do not represent a direct threat to the teams. Heavy rains washed away a bridge along the Juba-Terekeka road on 11 June, making the CASEVAC route unusable. The team had been in Juba at the time on leave. This, in combination with wet conditions in the area of operations slowing movements, and difficulty of procuring food/resources locally led management to take the decision to move all MAG teams out of Tindilo temporarily. When the team returned from leave, they returned to Tindilo to close their camp and relocate to Magwi county. The movements to and back out of Tindilo were slowed by frequent road closures due to bridges and subsequent repairs failing in the rain. Thus, while the team returned from leave on 17 June, they spent the remainder of the month engaged in close down activities such as preparing partial completion reports and benchmarks, and after that remobilising out of Tindilo. The delays also extended into the third quarter, with outputs in July also expected to be affected.",
    "As previously reported, heavy rains in Tindilo led MAG to relocate all teams out of Terekeka State for the remainder of the rainy season. This affected outputs throughout July. The team departed Tindilo on 2 July, following the completion of close down activities. However, as the road is not tarmacked, extremely poor conditions extended the journey from 10 hours to 12 days. The teams eventually reached Juba on 14 July. The journey led to significant wear and tear on the vehicles, and most of the remainder of July was spent on repairing equipment, mobilising to the new site in Magwi county, and setting up the new camp. Following a long down non-operational period, the team required refresher training prior to beginning operations. During July, MAG rotated TFMs. A new TFM was selected who has extensive experience in South Sudan (although an expat, he had been working with another operator in South Sudan at the time of recruitment) and also has experience with MAG. The new TFM had already received UNMAS accreditation with his former employer, and MAG expected the re-accreditation process with the new team to be a short and simple process. In the event, the accreditation was delayed as UNMAS security assessments temporarily prevented access to Magwi county by UNMAS EQA personnel. MAG liaised with a a commercial operator that had a suitable training facility in Nesitu, closer to Juba, and arranged with UNMAS personnel to conduct the accreditation there. As a result of the delays, the team lost close to two months of active operations.",
    "The team continued operations in Ame West, making good progress throughout the quarter. South Sudan experienced a particularly severe rainy season in 2019, which lasted well into the final quarter of the year.  Ame West is located in the southern \"hills and mountains\" zone of South Sudan, which has a relatively higher elevation and better drainage. Although the area of operations was not subject to severe flooding as elsewhere in South Sudan, heavy rains did continue to affect operations. The team was stopped from operating for partial days (between 1 and 6 hours) and contributing to small amounts of very localized flooding that affected the mobility of the team between camp and the task site. Due to the rains, vegetation remained very dense during the reporting period. The task site is located on the site of a former military base, with high levels of metal contamination including casings as well as domestic scrap metal slowing clearance speeds. Over 18,000 pieces of metal were found during the quarter. However, the team still made very good progress despite these challenges and achieved 67% of the quarterly target.",
    "The Dutch-funded team began operations in Ame West along the Juba-Nimule highway (Magwi county, close to the boarder with Juba County). In February, the team moved back to Sitto in Tindilo payam of Terekeka county in Central Equatoria in order to resume clearance while the dry season facilitated efficient operations. On 21 March 2020, all MAG operations in south Sudan were suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team will take annual and then special leave until operations are able to resume.",
    "No operations this quarter.  All operations suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. Remobilisation of Dutch-funded team expected August 2020",
    "During the quarter, MAG teams resumed operations, taking a staggered approach. Although the Juba International Airport opened to international flights in May 2020, many neighbouring countries and regional hubs (such as Nairobi and Dubai) remained close to international flights, making the return of international staff challenging. The Dutch-funded MTT began refresher training in August. Because of the length of the stand-down due to COVID-19 pandemic, a three-week long refresher training (Aug 3-23) was required and the team was therefore not able to resume clearance prior to the end of the grant period. However, the team did complete training and passed accreditation (August 24-26) and began operations under another project in September.",
