    "The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is supporting an emergency intervention in the northeast areas of Lebanon which from 2014 to 2017 have been occupied by Jabhat Al-Nusra, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other non-state armed groups. These areas are currently contaminated with a large number of improvised landmines, and other Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), as well as other Land Service Ammunition and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) caused by the fighting between security forces and non-state actors. With the support of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MAG will deploy clearance teams in the Ras Baalbek area to conduct clearance of Cluster munitions, UXO, conventional and improvised landmines. In parallel with clearance activities, the mine action authority?s ability to manage and support operations on IEDs will be strengthened through meetings aiming at revising the National Mine Action Standards (NMAS) to incorporate IEDs based on the latest IMAS revisions and updates.",

    "There was  a delay in securing the needed vehicles for teams. The programme was able to procure the needed detectors early September and the vehicles took longer time to reach the country and registered. So, clearanace team will be deployed in October as soon as the registration of the vehicles is complete and the weather permits.",
    "There was  a delay in securing the needed vehicles for teams and in October the country went through civil unrest where roads were closed for many days especially roads leading to Beirut. The progamme was able to receive the needed vehicles and register them late in December before christmas and new year stand down. Plans are to do refresher training for previoulsy selected deminers since it has been a long time since their original training and accreditation will follow in Janaury before their full deployment dependent on weather. The programme is also working on submitting a NCE for this project to ensure fulfilling this project's targets.",
    "The BAC team was deployed to one task in Younin, North East Lebanon. The hard, dry ground in the area of operation allows teams to use the large loop detector which increases clearance rates hugely. With the use of the large loop, the team was able to overachieve the clearance target despite the working days lost in March. MAG Lebanon implemented an operational stand down in response to the COVID-19 situation in country on 12th March which is still ongoing.",
    "The BAC team completed two tasks in Kherbit Dawood during this quarter and worked on three tasks in Wadi Martabia and Kherbit Dawood, Rass Ballabek. The team returned to work in mid May after going through refresher training. Despite the days lost due to COVID-19, the terrain which allows the use of the large loop allowed high clearance rates and allowed the teams to complete two tasks.",
    "The BAC teams worked on 10 tasks in Kherbit Dawood, Rass Baalbak during this quarter which were all completed during the quarter. Two extra teams were funded for a total of three months during this quarter which, combined with the focus on BAC tasks,  contributed to the high clearance results and tasks completed.",
