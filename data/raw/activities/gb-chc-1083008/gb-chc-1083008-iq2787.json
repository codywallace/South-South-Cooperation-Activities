Consequently, only their families (women and children) are present in households. Despite these obstacles, the CL team continues to prioritize men as the main at-risk target group. To enhance outreach to men, the team is expanding its efforts to reach them at their workplaces, such as farms, pasture and grazing areas, construction labour sites, markets, and various gathering places.

The MAT team working in Telkaif district (this team was originally deployed to Hamdaniya district, but as noted in the 2021 annual report, redeployed to neighbouring Telkaif as tasks in Telkaif are very large and required more teams), worked on an improvised minefield in the village of Batnay, clearing 21,490 square meters. Finally, the team deployed to conduct conventional minefield clearance in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk governorates cleared 5,060 square meters of very large conventional minefield in Wylawa village. The team deployed in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk governorates faced significant challenges during the early part of the quarter, as the minefield in Wylawa was inaccessible due to snow in January; normally MAG redeploys teams to winter tasks in Kirkuk which is less affected by winter snow, but in January 2022, there was a change in the local military commander and MAG's DNGO movement permissions were not recognized. In Ninewa governorate, winter weather at times slowed progress in January, as some tasks were too wet and muddy at times.",
    "In Kikuk throughout the reporting period, a MAT  worked on two minefield tasks releasing 8148 m2 land and safely removing 45 items (all conventional AP mines). The contaminated area was a military position and was reported in 2021 by Kuna Masi villagers to MAG's CL team and later was tasked by IKMAA to clearance teams. In terms of land use, the mountainous nature of the area attracts picknickers during spring and summer for its famous water springs and river, and one of the most famous mountains in Iraq, Hasanbag. Additionally, villagers and visitors enjoy collecting natural plants from the area during spring seasons, while grazing is what the land is used for, villlagers are supportive of MAG's removal of threats due to its high priority to the community, and for having lost most of their cattle, and one shepherd in UXO accidents. In Batnay village in Telkaif, one MAT cleared 17,310 m2 throughout June 2022 of an improvised minefield which used to be an ISIS defensive obstacle including multiple rows of IEDs. In June, in Sinjar's rural Tel Azeer village, one manual team completed an improvised minefield task by releasing 4,100 m2 of land, and safely removing one victim operated IED in this improvised minefield. The pre-clearance impact assessment of this task was conducted by a CL team in May 2022, and determined that 75% of the land was to be used for agricultural purposes, while the rest is expected to contribute to residential, infrastucture, and access needs.",
    "The Dutch funded MATs in Sinjar, Telkaif and Sulaymaniah worked on nine tasks in total, three of which were completed. The teams have found and removed 136 items through land release tasks. In Sulaymaniah, the teams released 17,520 m2 in five conventional minefields located in Sharbezher and Saed Sadiq districts - 132 AP conventional mines were removed. In Batnay village of Telkaif, one MAT worked on an improvised minefield task by releasing 4,280 m2 and removing two improvised AP mines. The pre-clearance impact assessment indicated that 90% of the land will be used by the community for agricultural purposes, and 10% will improve access to roads. One MAT worked on two tasks in Sinjar (one ongoing and one completed), clearing 15,402m2 and removing two improvised AP minefields. The pre-clearance impact assessment for the ongoing task in Sinjar indicated that the area, once returned to communities, will benefit them for residential, agricultural, and access purposes.",
    "Throughout the reporting quarter, three MATs were funded by this grant in Sinjar and Telkaif districts of Ninewa, and Penjwin district of Sulaymaniah where teams cleared land on six land release tasks; three improvised minefield in Telkaif, two improvised minefields in Sinjar, and one conventional minefield in Penjwin district.",
    "During the reporting period one MAT team was funded by this grant in Sinjar district of Ninewa governorate and the team worked on two improvised minefields, safely removing 3 items of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) and one small arms and ammunitions (SAA) for demolition. The area was occupied by ISIS in 2014 and then liberated in 2017. During the period of ISIS's presence, ISIS planted explosive devices. Residents of the village are not able to return because the area contains a lot of remnants of war (improvised explosive devices, unexploded ordnance). Additionally, many houses have been destroyed from battle damage or airstrikes. Once land is cleared people can return and rebuild their houses and use the land for farming. As planned in the 2023 workplan, the number of teams being deployed with support from the Dutch Government was reduced in 2023. In addition, land release outputs are lower than expected due to the suspension of operations in March 202 as a result of delays in the processing of Federal Iraq visas for international technical management staff. This suspension of operations was communicated to the Dutch Government at the beginning of March.",
    "During the reporting quarter, the Dutch funded two Mine Action Teams (MATs) in the Sinjar and Telkaif districts of Ninewa Governorate. These teams worked on four improvised minefields, safely removing 36 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO). These minefields are located in Kur Ishaq village of Telkaif district,  as well as Sharaeeh and Talatat villages of Sinjar district.  MAG received a new task order in Talatat village and the Dutch-funded MAT, along with teams funded  by other donors, commenced clearance in June 2023. The history of the contamination goes back to ISIS occupation and the minefields were initially laid by ISIS in 2014 as a defensive line to protect themselves from potential offensive attacks by the Iraqi army/militia. The area is within an agricultural region adjacent to a seasonal river. Clearing this area holds great significance as it will facilitate seasonal agriculture for farmers in the future. According to the pre-clearance impact assessment, it is anticipated that 90% of the cleared land will be utilized for agriculture, while the remaining 10% will serve as road access.",
    "During the reporting period, two MATs were funded by this grant in Sinjar and Telkaif districts of Ninewa Governorate. These teams worked on two improvised minefields, one in Sinjar district and one in Telkaif district. The task in Kur Ishaq village of Telkaif forms a critical segment of the defensive line of IEDs laid by ISIS in 2014 to defend themselves from Peshmarga forces. The ground conditions are characterized by hard soil with moderate vegetation. The contamination level is high, featuring a high density of IEDs and Improvised Anti-Personnel Mines, ranging from Projectile IEDs to Metal Pipe IEDs. The other task in Talatat village of Sinjar, where the contamination is in the middle of an agricultural land, is challenging to pinpoint due to its widespread nature along all boundaries of the polygon. The route to the area faced an obstacle when local farmers blocked it. This obstruction was attributed to the dust generated by vehicles, causing damage to crops. Therefore, the teams had to find another way in, however these obstacles have slowed down the work.",
    "During the reporting quarter, one MAT was supported for the full 3 months. The Dutch funded MAT team worked on three improvised minefields and one BAC task. The  ongoing task in Abra village where the teams commenced work in early October, is part of a huge area occupied by ISIS, between Talafar and Sinjar. The area consists of a large open space on one side, a former military position in the centre, and a deep gully running along the other side of the polygon.",

    "Improvised explosive devices that are victim operated with pressure plates were found and removed from Tel Azeer and Kfrok land release tasks, and from one spot task completed in Sinjar district.",
    "This quarter, one MAT funded by Dutch MFA transferred 657 VOs from two tasks in Telkaif for further action by the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) for demolition. This high number of improvised AP mines was due to the high IED contamination in a highly contaminated task - 654 items were removed from this completed  task in Batnaya village, and three other improvised AP mines were removed from another completed but smaller task in Batnaya village.",
