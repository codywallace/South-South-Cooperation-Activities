    "During EORE Sessions, the teams get information on the presence of EO in some locations. However, the locations happened to be not accessible for humanitarians due to the presence of non-state armed groups around the areas. Remote baseline contamination assessment (RCBA) were conducted instead of NTS. RCBA is an assessment tool for gathering information on contamination through interviewing beneficiaries. Information is recorded on a Survey 123 form that captures the data and submits it to the MAG database. The information about the presence and location of contamination is captured remotely.",
    "11 RCBAs were conducted in the quarter in Monguno and Ngala, as no incidents were reported in Konduga. RCBAs are only conducted when the community liaison teams receive reports of contamination from beneficiaries, as the team received fewer reports, the number of RCBAs is lower than the target. In the upcoming quarter, EORE sessions will be organized in Ngala, Monguno, Gowza and Bama and Banki where more RCBAs are planned given higher expected rates of reporting of EO contamination.",
    "Six RCBAs were conducted in this quarter. RCBAs are only conducted when the Community Liaison Teams hear of contamination from beneficiaries. The Community Liaison Teams then work with community members to report this contamination as RCBAs. As the team heard of fewer incidents, the number of RCBAs is lower than the target. As there remain only 13 RCBAs until the target is reached, MAG is confident that it will achieve the overall project target. Furthermore, an additional three RCBAs were conducted in December, which were unfortunately ommitted from the previously submitted IATI, and have been reflected in the current IATI.",
    "MAG conducted 15 RCBAs in the reporting period and has now reached the target for the project period RCBAs were conducted for Ngala, Gwoza and Bama. RCBAs are only conducted when the Community Liaison Team hear of contamination from beneficiaries.",
    "MAG conducted 5 RCBAs in the reporting period. MAG has reached the target for the project period. A total of 207 RCBAs has been conducted as part of the project (103% completed).",
    "No trainings planned for this year. This projection total includes the following: # of police officers (men & women) trained in EOD (6 total); # of CJTF members (men & women) trained (20 total); and # of CFPs (men & women) trained (20 total). There will also be 1 baseline assessment conducted of police EOD capacity",
    "No trainings planned for this quarter.",

    "The next training sessions are scheduled to take place after the election period, i.e., at the end of the first quarter of 2023.",
    "MAG trained 8 CFPs (3 men and 5 women) in Ngala and Gwoza LGA in the reporting period. CFPs are selected by the community in collaboration with MAG CLOs. Community leaders identify active and well respected members of their community who demonstrate a willingness to support MAG. They are trained on community liaison and risk education, as well as reporting identified EO and accidents involving EO.",
    "46 male and 29 females from humanitarian organisations (IRC, IOM, Intersos, etc) were trained on EO awareness during the quarter. The training courses were held in Monguno, Gwoza and MMC. In April and June, MAG also trained 175 humanitarian workers in Ngala (113 male, 62 female), Gwoza, Monguno and Bama LGAs although they were not reflected in the previous quarter IATI. The number has been adjusted in the relevant column.The target of 170 people trained = 20 CFPs + 150 INGO workers, which was an activity that was approved by the donor in January 2023",
    "No outputs for this quarter as project began in September.",
    "No trainings planned for this quarter.",
    "During the training, Community Focal Points (CFPs) are trained in EORE. They learn about the different types of explosive devices, and how to conduct risk education sessions. They are also trained to identify risk areas and educate on safe behaviours. The 7 CFPs participated in a training session in Bama, Borno state to inform them about their role.",

The first month of the project focused on recruitment for several new CLO staff, training (including refresher training for long-time MAG CL staff), induction, and other HR/admin matters related to recruitment. Training of staff included a range of topics including technical methodology of community liaison/EORE/NTS/RCBA, reporting/data collection, safeguarding, security, field practicum, and competency assessment. Implementation of activities to begin in Q5.",
    "The project is slightly behind on projected targets due to delayed start to activities. The delay was due to the high level of recruitment and training required for the project, including onboarding of 10 new field staff. Several weeks of training for new staff, and refresher training for current staff, as well as a week-long gender workshop in October contributed to the delays in activities. Additionally, there was a 2-week stand-down period during December in observation of the holiday period during which time activities were not carried out. Field deployments officially began in October and activities have been conducted in Konduga and Jere Local Government Areas of Nigeria. MAG expects to catch up with targets by the next quarterly reporting period.",
    "The program has underachieved on this target due to deployment delays on account of insecurity. As new security procedures require a field security assessment to be conducted prior to any deployments of staff to target locations, there were unanticipated delays in security assessments that took longer than expected. Moving forward, field teams will be increasing the number of EORE sessions conducted per day from 3 to 4 in order to reach the target of EORE sessions",
    "The sessions were held at the following LGAs: Bama, Jere, Konduga and Ngala.",
    "During this quarter, 5 community liaison teams were deployed to conduct these sessions. The sessions were held in Monguno, Konduga, and Ngala LGAs. These locations have been selected in line with needs for EORE and the prevalence of accidents involving landmines and EO in these locations.  Fewer MRE sessions were held during this period due to the closing of operations for the holidays.",
    "The sessions were held Monguno and Gwoza LGA. MAG underachieved in the number of MRE sessions for this quarter, owing to several activity standdowns during the elections period. Teams were stood down for almost three weeks due to election-related security concerns. The teams have since resumed full deployments for the upcoming quarter, which will serve to increase the number of MRE sessions. MAG is conscious that, based on actual activity to date and the remaining project time, the total MRE session target (6,000) might not be reached by the end of the project. However, MAG is confident that the project target for MRE beneficiaries will still be met. The 6,000 session target was set during the Covid-19 pandemic when the number of attendees per session was limited due to social distancing restrictions. Since these restrictions have been lifted, the number of attendees per session has increased. MAG is therefore confident that the beneficiary target will still be met.",
    "MRE sessions were held in Bama, Jere, Konduga, Gwoza and Ngala Local Government Areas. Based on the current activity rate, it is unlikley that MAG will meet the target of 6,000 sessions. The 6,000 session target was set during the Covid-19 pandemic when the number of attendees per session was limited due to social distancing restrictions. However, since these restrictions have been lifted, the number of attendees per session has increased. MAG has already reached the target for female RE beneficiaries and child RE beneficiaries.",
    "334 MRE sessions were held in the Gwoza and Monungo Local Government Areas during the final quarter of the project. As previously reported, MAG was not able to meet the target of 6,000 sessions. The 6,000 session target was set during the Covid-19 pandemic when the number of attendees per session was limited due to social distancing restrictions. However, since these restrictions have been lifted, the number of attendees per session has increased. The reduction in the number of sessions did not impact the number of beneficiaries targeted.",

MAG slightly underachieved in the number of male MRE beneficiaries; this reflects not only the demographic of the area of intervention (there are predominantly more women and children in IDP camps), but also that men tend to be conducting income-earning activities during the times when MRE sessions are held.  CLT will focus on reaching additional male MRE recipients in the upcoming quarter.",

However, MAG has slightly underachieved in the number of male beneficiaries (there are predominantly more women and children IDP camps). In order to correct this, MAG has been targeting areas of intervention where there are more males. For instance, MAG conducted dedicated sessions in markets for hunters and wood and scrap metal gatherers (professions that are typically male-dominated) in order to reach male beneficiaries. This population demographic is also particularly at risk from the threats posed by EO given their profession.",

    "Fewer male beneficairies were reached due to demographics of IDP camps where fewer men were present, in addition to the fact that most men were conducting livelihood activities during the day when MAG teams conducted EORE sessions.",
    "8,160 beneficiaries were reached during the reporting period in Monguno, Konduga, and Ngal. There were fewer male MRE recipients as men tend to be conducting economic activities such as farming instead. The teams have identified that men are less interested in MRE sessions if there is no material benefit in exchange for their presence. As MAG did not have EORE materials to give for this particular quarter, the number male of beneficiaries is below target. MAG is looking to acquire additional MRE materials in the upcoming quarter to attract a greater male audience.",
