    "MAG is discussing with NMAC (SSTU) possible dates for manual demining training - UDA personnel will also join this training. Training is planned to take place in MEREFA training area for mid-July.",
    "The training for the UDA colleagues and the personnel from SSTS will be organised and delivered in Q4, as MAG took initiative to strengthen these activities and procure with the support of another donor technical equipment which will be handed over to SSTS personnel to be used for clearance of the critical infrastructure. It will take time to procure the equipment such as detectors and PPE, so the training will be organised in Q4",
    "During the third quarter, MAG met with the National Mine Action Center (NMAC) in November to discuss training for NMAC personnel. The deputy of the NMAC stressed the importance of quality assurance (QA) training, highlighting its relevance to their work with operators. With an increasing number of personnel responsible for QA checks in the field, the NMAC sought training to enhance their procedures for both national and international operators. After thorough discussions, MAG agreed to provide the Quality Assurance course in January, supported by the Standards and Training Specialist Coordinator. Training materials were finalized in December, and the NMAC approved them for training commencement in early January 2024. Finally, a planned Basic Deminers course for UDA will be postponed to the fourth quarter, when better weather conditions are expected.",
    "Number of people trained (m/f)151414\"As reported in the previous quarter, the Basic Deminers Course for Ukrainian Deminers Association staff was postponed due to adverse weather conditions. 4 men and 1 women from UDA took part in the Basic Deminer Training between 4th March and 29th March 2024. As with the MAG team mentioned above, training was disrupted, so additional days have been added to this training so that assessments can be conducted. The team are due to finish this course at the beginning of the next quarter.Between 29th January and 2nd February 9 National Mine Action Center (NMAC) staff were given training in Quality, Information and Risk Management Training in Chernihiv, this included 7 men and 2 women.\"",
    "As reported in the previous quarter, the Basic Deminers Course for UDA staff was extended into this quarter. The five UDA staff members who took part in this training successfully completed the course. Additionally, a further five UDA staff members commenced Basic Deminer training in Mykolaiv in June, and are due to complete this in July. As mentioned above, one MAG team successfully completed training on the basic deminers course, and a third team is undergoing this training.",

    "MAG Ukraine applied for NTS certification in May 2023, as NTS was specifically requested by the government of Ukraine to analyze the scope of contamination, and NTS will be highly beneficial for the future planning of clearance activities. In parallel, MAG started adopting global SOPs for NMAS to be able to submit the required documents for the certification of technical surveys, battle area clearance (BAC), and manual demining. The first demining teams will complete the internal Basic Deminer Course, after which the submission for certification will be launched. Clearance operations are planned for October or November after completion of the certification process. However, this timeline is not guaranteed, as there are several risks that might affect planning, such as: the importation of technical equipment, mandatory conscription for male staff, the highly fluid security situation, and weather conditions through autumn.",

    "The major achievement during the Q2 of this project is the successful completion of Non-Technical Survey (NTS) certification, a critically important activity for the identification of the suspected or confirmed hazardous areas for the future demining tasks. NTS also helps to cancel the area where there is sufficient evidence of the absence of the explosive remnants of war and hand it back to communities without further interventions. The certificate was officially handed over to MAG on 29th of August and MAG received its first official tasking from the National Mine Action Centre on 1 October, due to the bureaucratic nature of the paperwork for the official permissions for the team. MAG expects to start implementing NTS activities in Q3 to prepare future polygons for the demining activities that will follow after NTS. MAG submitted the documentation for the certification for Technical Survey (TS), Manual Mine Clearance (MMC) and Battle Area Clearance (BAC) in September. Certification will be completed in November, after which demining operations will commence. It should be noted that winter weather conditions can significantly affect the demining process, as it is impossible to conduct demining operations on frozen ground. MAG will do as much demining as they can before the winter sets in, but a majority of the work will carry over in to the spring of 2024. Additionally following the signing if a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Energy on 22nd of August, to support the demining of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine, a team will be on stand by through out the winter to help where it can with clearance of critical infrastructure.",
    "\"During the third quarter of this project, MAG achieved significant milestones including the successful completion of certification in Manual Mine Clearance , Battle Area Clearance (BAC), and Technical Survey (TS) on November 10th. This achievement followed a successful field-testing visit by the National Mine Action Centre on November 3rd. Additionally, MAG received its first official \"\"task order,\"\" assigning it to conduct clearance operations in areas previously identified as hazardous (confirmed or suspected) by Community Liaison teams. Unfortunately, adverse weather conditions prevented the commencement of clearance operations post-certification. However, plans are in place to initiate operations in early spring when weather conditions are more suitable.The Basic Deminer course is planned for Q4, so the team is ready start operations when the weather allows. MAG faced a real challenge last year to import detectors into Ukraine, which cause a delay in the implementation of the clearance activities in the first place, with the detectors only arriving in September 2023.Further importation challenges continue, particularly around the importation of the vehicles, including ambulances, which are needed for demining operations. According to the latest law about humanitarian aid, the vehicles can be imported only to be handed over to military or governmental institutions. MAG is trying to resolve this issue (with close oversight and support from the HQ) by seeking advice from other operators who have faced similar challenges and by garnering Ministry level support, as well as advocating for a more rationale interpretation of the law allowing generally more easy importation of specialist equipment. As an interim measure and where strictly necessary MAG plans to procure vehicles in country and modify the procured vehicles into ambulances, which is allowed for operations. Conscription might become a future challenge, especially with the introduction of adjustments to the age criteria, affecting certain groups of people who were not previously targeted for conscription. MAG is working on obtaining the status of a «critically important for the functioning of the economy and ensuring the livelihood of the population in a special period» (Decree dated January 27, 2023 No. 76), which will allow MAG to exempt a certain percentage of personnel from conscription, defined by ministry of Defence.   Separately, MAG is working hard to produce an equitable working environment for women (who are exempt currently from conscription) that takes into consideration the fact that many women are often the only person at home with their children and / or elderly parents; as often their partners are already serving on the front lines. This has meant that in the last round of recruitment for deminers 81% were women.\"",
    "In February, MAG recruited 3 women and 3 men to be trained as deminers to make up 1 Multi-Task Team (MTT) to be funded under this grant. These 6 men and women completed 40-hours of mandatory First Aid Training in Kropyvnitski.Upon completion of this training, they then attended a Basic Deminer Course (BDC) from 4th March - 29th March. Due to adverse weather conditions during BDC training, it was decided that the deminers would need to complete further training in April on areas which had been identified by MAG's Standards and Training Team as areas needing further improvement before deployment. This training is scheduled to take place in mid to late April. Upon completion of this training, the team will then be able to be deployed onto task-sites to begin clearance activities. Recruitment for the 2 other MTT's funded by this grant is ongoing and these teams are expected to be recruited and trained by mid May.In Q4 MAG has made significant success with importation and procurement. MAG tested the new Ukraine Humanitairian aid importation system by sucessfully importing some Minewolf spare parts, which has given us confidence to use this system again, and will potentially mitigate the difficulties experienced in previous quarters.",
    "Using Non-Technical Survey (NTS) interventions, MAG potentially can cancel suspected hazardous areas when there is enough evidence of the absence of explosive ordnance, allowing safe return of the area to communities without further clearance intervention, which is usually time-consuming. MAG CL team was deployed to conduct NTS in total of 10 districts of Mykolaiv region including Buzke, Voznesenske, Malosolone, Stepove, Hryhorivske and Vasylivka, Prybuzhany, Martynivske, Dmytrivka and Yastrubynove communities.  MAG CL team ensured that women, girls, men, and boys participated in MAG community engagement activities in order to gather enough information of possible Explosive Ordnance (EO) contamination.  All relevant information was identified, accessed, collected, and analysed accordingly, as a result, there is no evidence of EO contamination in those territories. Nonetheless, MAG continues providing mine awareness activities to ensure that beneficiaries, when they relocate to other locations where the possible presence of Explosive Ordnance may exist, are aware of the associated risks and are encouraged to behave in ways that reduce these risks.",

    "MAG works in close coordination with the National Mine Action Centre (NMAC) and other operators to ensure that mine action (MA) activities, including EORE, are implemented in a prioritised manner by the government, while avoiding duplication with other MA actors. In June 2023, MAG initiated discussions with NMAC to deploy a Community Liaison Team to start work in Mykolaiv Oblast, which will become a future area for demining operations once contaminated areas are confirmed through NTS. To start operations in former Russian-occupied areas with a potentially high level of explosive ordnance contamination, MAG staff members conducted security and technical assessments. After careful consideration, the decision was taken to set up an office in Mykolaiv city. The process of obtaining all mandatory permits from both NMAC and the Mykolaiv oblast administration delayed operations but were required to be able to start proper planning of the EORE activities.  Community Liaison Teams are implementing a comprehensive approach for future demining operations, conducting both EORE and NTS, an approach which is highly beneficial for the potentially contaminated communities. MAG successfully passed mandatory field testing on NTS and plans to deploy the CL team on 1 September with proper planning of activities in districts assigned by NMAC. In addition, MAG will sign an agreement with our local partner UDA on 1 August related to the delivery of EORE. The indicators will not be affected.",

MAG signed the contract with UDA on 1st of August 2023. UDA trained deployed and trained 2 teams on EORE during August, who started implementation on the field actual sessions in September. During this quarter, a total of 8 EORE sessions were carried out by 1 MAG CL team and 2 UDA EORE teams in Kirovogradska and Mykolaivska oblasts. MAG works closely with UDA to ensure the delivery of the EORE sessions is in accordance to the internal SOPs and international and national mine action standard. A total of 136 beneficiaries ( including men,  women, boys and girls) have been reached by the EORE safety messages, which improved the knowledge of expected 80% of the total number of beneficiaries, the analysed data will be reported on Q13 (3).  The beneficiaries include farmers, workers, IDPs, returnees and elderly people, who are at risk, especially during the autumn season, when they are forced to collect the wood and mushrooms to survive economically.",

    "\"The CL team continued to deliver lifesaving lessons to communities across Mykolaiv region, in Voznesensk and Mykolaiv Raions. The Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs-funded teams conducted 50 Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) sessions in the reporting period, reaching a total of 894 beneficiaries, which included 116 women, 76 men, 351 girls and 351 boys. In order to measure the impact of the sessions and the knowledge gained or retained, the teams conducted 16 Risk Education Pre- Post- (REPP) tests. These tests assess the knowledge of participants before and after the sessions to detect any change in understanding from participants. Of the 16 participants who were assessed, including two people with disabilities, 94% showed an improvement in their knowledge. On 4th April, CL teams delivered EORE sessions on International Mine Awareness Day, during which they were joined by a MAG deminer, who gave participants an explanation of the work they do and the tools that they use to do their job. This initiative was well-received with all groups that sessions were delivered to. As a result, CL teams have continued to replicate the sessions each Friday, where they are joined by a deminer.During the reporting period, The Ukrainian Deminers Association (UDA) deployed two CL teams in Odesa, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy regions, where they delivered 43 lifesaving EORE sessions, reaching 1107 people, which included 118 women, 40 men, 416 girls and 533 boys.Please note, the number of EORE sessions and beneficiaries for Q12 of this project has been updated following recent data verification procedures by MAG's Information Management team.\"",
    "MAG Ukraine applied for NTS certification in May 2023, as NTS was specifically requested by the government of Ukraine to analyze the scope of contamination, and NTS will be highly beneficial for the future planning of clearance activities. In parallel, MAG started adopting global SOPs for NMAS to be able to submit the required documents for the certification of technical surveys, battle area clearance (BAC), and manual demining. The first demining teams will complete the internal Basic Deminer Course, after which the submission for certification will be launched. Clearance operations are planned for October or November after completion of the certification process. However, this timeline is not guaranteed, as there are several risks that might affect planning, such as: the importation of technical equipment, mandatory conscription for male staff, the highly fluid security situation, and weather conditions through autumn.",
    "The major achievement during the Q2 of this project is the successful completion of Non-Technical Survey (NTS) certification, a critically important activity for the identification of the suspected or confirmed hazardous areas for the future demining tasks. NTS also helps to cancel the area where there is sufficient evidence of the absence of the explosive remnants of war and hand it back to communities without further interventions. The certificate was officially handed over to MAG on 29th of August and MAG received its first official tasking from the National Mine Action Centre on 1 October, due to the bureaucratic nature of the paperwork for the official permissions for the team. MAG expects to start implementing NTS activities in Q3 to prepare future polygons for the demining activities that will follow after NTS. MAG submitted the documentation for the certification for Technical Survey (TS), Manual Mine Clearance (MMC) and Battle Area Clearance (BAC) in September. Certification will be completed in November, after which demining operations will commence. It should be noted that winter weather conditions can significantly affect the demining process, as it is impossible to conduct demining operations on frozen ground. MAG will do as much demining as they can before the winter sets in, but a majority of the work will carry over in to the spring of 2024. Additionally following the signing if a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Energy on 22nd of August, to support the demining of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine, a team will be on stand by through out the winter to help where it can with clearance of critical infrastructure.",

MAG faced a real challenge last year to import detectors into Ukraine, which cause a delay in the implementation of the clearance activities in the first place, with the detectors only arriving in September 2023.Further importation challenges continue, particularly around the importation of the vehicles, including ambulances, which are needed for demining operations. According to the latest law about humanitarian aid, the vehicles can be imported only to be handed over to military or governmental institutions. MAG is trying to resolve this issue (with close oversight and support from the HQ) by seeking advice from other operators who have faced similar challenges and by garnering Ministry level support, as well as advocating for a more rationale interpretation of the law allowing generally more easy importation of specialist equipment. As an interim measure and where strictly necessary MAG plans to procure vehicles in country and modify the procured vehicles into ambulances, which is allowed for operations. Conscription might become a future challenge, especially with the introduction of adjustments to the age criteria, affecting certain groups of people who were not previously targeted for conscription. MAG is working on obtaining the status of a «critically important for the functioning of the economy and ensuring the livelihood of the population in a special period» (Decree dated January 27, 2023 No. 76), which will allow MAG to exempt a certain percentage of personnel from conscription, defined by ministry of Defence.

    "In February, MAG recruited 3 women and 3 men to be trained as deminers to make up 1 Multi-Task Team (MTT) to be funded under this grant. These 6 men and women completed 40-hours of mandatory First Aid Training in Kropyvnitski.Upon completion of this training, they then attended a Basic Deminer Course (BDC) from 4th March - 29th March. Due to adverse weather conditions during BDC training, it was decided that the deminers would need to complete further training in April on areas which had been identified by MAG's Standards and Training Team as areas needing further improvement before deployment. This training is scheduled to take place in mid to late April. Upon completion of this training, the team will then be able to be deployed onto task-sites to begin clearance activities. Recruitment for the 2 other MTT's funded by this grant is ongoing and these teams are expected to be recruited and trained by mid May.In Q4 MAG has made significant success with importation and procurement.

    "During the reporting period, MAG finalised the recruitment and training processes for the three Multi-Task Teams (MTTs) funded by this grant. Two previously trained teams were scheduled to begin clearance operations at a battle area clearance (BAC) task site. However, this request was rejected by the National Mine Action Centre (NMAC),  which has prioritised minefield clearance tasks. In addition, recent legislation from the NMAC now requires mine action providers to obtain further permissions from local regional authorities in order to operate. MAG has re-submitted the task order and remains optimistic that approval will be granted in the next quarter, allowing the teams to begin clearance operations. The third MTT funded by this grant commenced the Basic Deminer Course training in June. Upon successful completion of training and tasking, this team is expected to be deployed to a task site in Mykolaiv region in the next quarter.Although MAG successfully procured the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the teams funded under this grant, the vehicle procurement remained challenging. As previously communicated, the procurement and conversion of vehicles are expected to be lengthy due to the extended duration of the tendering procedures and the high demand for vehicles to support mine action efforts in Ukraine. By the end of the reporting period, MAG had established tender processes for acquiring two minibuses. Additionally, the procurement of two vans for conversion into ambulances has been initiated. These ambulances will be deployed alongside the two MTTs to ensure swift response to any medical emergencies in the field. MAG anticipates that the procurement and conversion will be completed in Q16 or Q17 and will continue to monitor progress closely, providing all relevant updates as required."
