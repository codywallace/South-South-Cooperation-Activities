The land is mainly being used for agricultural activities with the cultivation of simsim, cassava, maize and beans for home consumption and selling. Beneficiaries have created many paths across the cleared land for access between different farms. Some people have settled on the land but this is limited as there is a shortage of water points in the area so people will relocate during dry season. The local government is planning to install a borehole next year. It is expected that land usage will increase next year as some of the land was only recently cleared. The community also benefitted from support by FSVL NGO Action Against Hunger who provided cash and training on agricultural activities. The task site is in an area that is seeing relatively high numbers of returnees from Uganda, so beneficiary numbers are expected to increase over the next few months.",
