    "The persistent threat from cluster munitions and landmines in Lebanon continues to hinder socio-economic reconstruction efforts as well as threaten the physical safety and security of affected communities. Contamination remains from over 30 years of internal and regional conflicts. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990, together with the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000, resulted in huge levels of infrastructure destruction and a significant legacy of landmines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) across Lebanon. The impact of contamination has been further exacerbated by the Syrian Civil War. Currently over one million Syrian refugees have sought safety in Lebanon, which represents around 25% of Lebanon’s population. Over 35% (360,000) of these refugees currently reside in the heavily contaminated region of the Bekaa Valley. The consistent influx has not only led to an increased strain on economic resources, heightened tensions between host and refugee communities, but has significantly increased the physical threat to vulnerable groups from exposure to legacy contamination in the Bekaa and southern Lebanon. MAG’s work is an integral part of the implementation of the LMAC Mine Action Strategy 2011-2021, which emphasizes the need for continued mine action to achieve a Lebanon free from the impact of cluster munitions by 2020 (in accordance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions) and of landmines by 2021. By continuing to provide a substantial clearance capacity, this project will positively impact local communities and Syrian refugees by directly removing the threat from cluster munitions and landmines, raise awareness of the risk through RE sessions, and provide up to date contamination and impact data to support evidence prioritisation of tasks."

    "MAG will take a 10% survey rate throughout the MRE sessions. From the response rate number, a 75% positive response rate has been projected of which the final numbers have been spread over the milestones according to project implementation planning in-country. the response rate projection is based on MAG's internal expertise and experience. The programme will be unable to conduct a thorough baseline prior to beginning work on the assigned tasks. This is due to a number of reasons related to the volatile security situation in South Sudan. At proposal stage, MAG was preparing to work in the Equatoria states but following the outbreak of violence that from Juba spread across the country in July 2016, MAG has been re-tasked to alternative locations as it was no longer safe to deploy demining teams to the original selected areas. The change of geographical locations has led to a number of issues. For example: although it is now increasingly clear that for the remainder of 2017 our teams will be mostly working on two BAC sites, MAG cannot predict the type of contamination that our teams will be clearing from 2018 onwards. Because the security situation changes and UNMAS, the tasking authority in South Sudan, is not able to give advance notice of where they will be assigning our teams, we are also unable to carry out meaningful baseline assessments. This means that the calculations for beneficiaries numbers and square meters of land released, have been calculated based on MAG's experience in-country and on assessments we have carried out in the past. For these reasons, it is possible that the programme's projection of target outputs may display some discrepancies with actual outputs.",

    "during this quarter, the teams were able to increase performance and reach relatively better outputs after reviewing performance by senior ops management",
    "the teams were slightly underachieving on land release outputs due to hard terrain conditions and high contamination during this phase. This is reflected in the number of items found during the reporting period.",
    "Teams under this project are still working on high impact tasks as prioritised by the Lebanon Mine Action Centre. This high impact is reflected by the higher number of items found and destroyed. Level and type of contamination in addition to slopy and rocky rerrain on assigned tasks cauased slight under achievement in land release outputs. Clearance plans take into consideration multiple factors affecting pace and methodology of clearance.",
    "During this quarter, the teams were able to achieve expected outputs, with minor underachievements. Clearance activities during this reporting period were affected by weather conditions (heavy rain and wet soil) preventing the teams from overachieving to cover previous gaps.",
    "Clearance teams lost many operational days during this quarter. Clearance plans were designed to generate additional outputs to cover lost productivity during previous quarters. Extreme weather conditions caused loss of operational days and a landmine accidnet during the first week of February on one of MAG's operational sites also caused loss of operational days. This all has resulted in delivering good results against anticipated targets for this quarter but not enough to achieve additional outputs.The teams were deployed to conduct clearance in the West Bekaa area (Maydoun and Quaraoun) and in southern Lebanon (Sriyreh) in support of Lebanese and refugee communities.As highlighted at the end of last quarter, the programme discussed amended clearance plans with the LMAC that were intended to increase outputs during this quarter. The deployment of sub-teams assisted and supported by mechanical machines allowed for increased productivity. additionally, the implementation of updated NMAS allowed for addtional outputs given the improved methodology.",
    "The teams were able to complete this quarter with good results. They continued deployment to West Bekaa area in Maydoun and Quaraoun to conduct clearance of cluster munitions and UXO items. During this quarter, the clearance team was deployed for two months only. During June 2018, the team was funded under a different donor after the senior management decision based on financial needs in the programme. Relatively speaking, results during these two months, inspite of the loss of operational days because of Ramadan standdown period, were very good.",
    "One team per month  had been deployed for BAC tasks in Nabatieh Area in Kfartibnite, Kfour and in AlQaroun and Majdal Balhis in West Bekaa area. The team completed the task in AlQaroun and it was handed back to community. Lost days were a result of public holidays and office move. In July, two BAC teams were deployed, in August one BAC team was deployed and in September three teams were covered by this grant, one BAC and two minefields, due to senior management planning and available funds from other donors. Average teams deployed is two teams per month.",
    "One BAC team was deployed for one month during the reporting period. The plan for this year was one team per month for 12 months, however as informed in the previous reporting period, due to grants management and senior management planning two teams per month were covered during the previous reporting period leaving one month funding for one team this quarter in December. In December, the weather was rainy and the team faced harsh weather conditions, the programme stood down starting from the 21st of December for Christmas and New Year stand down period and the task was internally suspended until the team redeploy after the stand down period.",
    "One team was deployed to continue clearance on a BAC task in MajdalBalhis, West Bekaa. The Clearance team lost many operational days during this quarter. Extreme weather conditions caused loss of operational days, however, the team was able to achieve 86% of this quarter's outputs since they benefted from change in NMAS regarding clearance depth in BAC tasks.",
    "One team was deployed to conduct BAC clearance on an ongoing task in MajdalBalhis. The team cleared 18,900m2 of land which exceeded this quarter's traget benefitting from good weather conditions & changes in NMAS.",
    "One team was deployed to conduct BAC clearance on an ongoing task in Majdal Balhis. The team cleared 17,320m2 of land, with rocky terrain affecting progress against the quarterly target.",
    "One team was deployed to conduct BAC clearance on an ongoing task in MajdalBalhis. The team cleared 26,795m2 of land which is above this quarter's target since the area where the team had been working is flat without rocks or high metal contamination. Also, the programme anticipated weather conditions to affect operations more at the time of planning targets. However, the team only lost a few days in December only due to weather conditions which increased outputs. Even though the country went through uncivil rest during this quarter and MAG closed its office and teams were not deployed to the field to ensure safety for the staff and safety routes to the hosiptals is guarenteed, the team was able to over achieve this quarter's target due to the nature of the tasks allowed high clearance rate.",
    "One BAC team was deployed to condcuct BAC tasks during this quarter. The team was able to achieve 60% of the target despite the days lost due to COVID-19 stand down period. On May 11th, and according to LMAC's instructions teams went through refrehser training gradually and were deployed to their tasks afterwards. The Dutch funded team was deployed on 1st of June 2020. The team lost 45% of the expected working days and was able to achieve 60% of the target. The team completed one task and moved to an adjacent task during this quarter.",
    "One BAC team was funded in July 2020 only as this represented the remaining capacity to be deployed under the project, following adjustments earlier in 2020 that saw more Dutch funded capacity deployed at an earlier stage. Due to this the team was able to only achieve 48% of the target.",
