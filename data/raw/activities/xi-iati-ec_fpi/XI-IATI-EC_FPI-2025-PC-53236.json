    "Contract related to: EU Support to Clearance Action for Safety and Security in Explosive Ordnance-Affected Communities in Armenia - The EU¿s objective in the South Caucasus is to promote security, stability, and sustainable peace in the region.Leveraging in-depth experience from peacebuilding efforts in the region, this 18-month exceptional assistance measure will contribute to the normalisation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan, to the strengthening of resilience against destabilisation from foreign interference, and to human security. The action will aim to enhance sustainable capacities of peacebuilding actors in the countries, including by investing into a new generation of peacebuilders and fostering outreach among wider audiences. It will support cross-conflict and domestic dialogues to mitigate potential new conflict lines within the Armenian and Azerbaijani societies, as well as work on collective trauma, displacement, and human security. The action will furthermore aim to foster an information space conducive to cohesion, normalisation and peace as well as societal resilience to Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI), through engagement with media professionals and civil society, media literacy promotion and strategic communication support as relevant. To ensure the EU¿s ability to adjust quickly to both new challenges and openings, the initiative will include a Rapid Response Mechanism."
