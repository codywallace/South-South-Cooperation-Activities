In addressing the broader mine action needs in northeast Syria (NES), beyond the immediate requirement for survey, clearance and Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE), there is a general lack of coordination of activities, integrated information management, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and standard indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of mine action activities.</p>"
