    "Contract related to: Explosive Ordnance Risk Reduction: Reactive Global Governance and Innovation Hub - Many countries face the issue of contamination of their territories with mines or other explosive remnants of war from recent or past conflicts, which endangers the lives of civilians and impacts on the return of economic activity in the affected areas. An effective mine action strategy and governance structures are crucial to put the available mine action resources, such as for survey and clearance activities, to the most efficient and effective use as well as to strengthen compliance with international mine action standards. In addition, since demining activities can incur high costs, affected countries are confronted with the challenge of ensuring a transparent financing of the sector, including with international donor support and the inclusion of private sector actors. This action will provide additional expertise to mine-affected countries on the formulation of governance structures and strategies for the management of their mine action sector."
