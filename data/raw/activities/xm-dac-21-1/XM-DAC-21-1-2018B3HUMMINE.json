    "Humanitarian mine action contributes to the overarching goal of saving and protecting lives and alleviating suffering, and other policy priorities including global hunger, fragile states and economic growth.",
    "One World, One Future emphasises that ‘mine action will remain a key issue for Ireland’ and our Humanitarian Policy emphasises that ‘support for humanitarian demining and weapons & ammunition disposal makes an important contribution to Ireland’s priority action for increased focus on situations of fragility’. This budget line also contributes to Ireland’s foreign policy objectives in the disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons area, as well as to our international treaty obligations to help poor countries to reduce risks to civilians from remnants of past conflicts, including anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions."
