    "The Initiative aims to ensure that humanitarian and early recovery actors can deliver assistance and services safely, while the civilian population is informed and aware of how to mitigate the risks associated with explosive ordnance. In the context of the protracted Syrian crisis, UNMAS serves as a facilitator for the humanitarian and early recovery response, enabling these actors to operate without the risks posed by explosive ordnance contamination. The Initiative includes the mapping, marking, and clearance of explosive ordnance in communities involved in humanitarian assistance or early recovery programmes. It also promotes the integration of humanitarian demining activities into UN strategic plans and advocacy efforts, and conducts training and community outreach activities to raise awareness about the risks associated with explosive ordnance.",
    "L'Iniziativa mira a garantire che gli attori umanitari e di early recovery possano fornire assistenza e servizi in condizioni di sicurezza, mentre la popolazione civile è informata e consapevole su come mitigare i rischi associati agli ordigni esplosivi. Nel contesto della crisi siriana protratta, UNMAS funge da facilitatore per la risposta umanitaria e di early recovery, consentendo agli attori umanitari e di early recovery di operare senza rischi legati alla contaminazione da ordigni esplosivi. L’iniziativa comprende interventi di mappatura, marcatura e rimozione di ordigni esplosivi nelle comunità coinvolte in programmi di assistenza umanitaria o di early recovery, promuove l’integrazione delle attività di sminamento umanitario nei piani strategici e nelle azioni di advocacy delle Nazioni Unite, e realizza attività di formazione e sensibilizzazione comunitaria per aumentare la consapevolezza sui rischi associati agli ordigni esplosivi."
