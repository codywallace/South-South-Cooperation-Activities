The purpose of the symposium is to address, in-depth, topics including The Incheon Strategy and its relationship to the implementation of the Convention, victim assistance funding, regional approaches to cooperation in mine action and the United Nations Mine Action Strategy. Funding under this initiative supports the attendance of 25 delegates from developing countries and the production of the symposium outcome publication.
