    "Australia's bilateral aid to the Republic of Palau focuses on the following three strategic objectives:\n1.  Reducing the threats from explosive remnants of war.  Palau was a major battlefield in World War II and the vast amounts of unexploded bombs, mines and artillery shells have been a danger to people and a hindrance to effective land use and development.  \n2.  Achieving greater gender quality and enhancing women's empowerment \n3.  Co-finance with the World Bank a project that will reform the Information Communication and Technology (ICT) sector as part of a wider project to lay a new submarine cable that will provide more stable and faster access to the internet for the government, private sector, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), schools and individuals.  Australian assistance will focus on providing technical assistance to improve the ICT policy and regulatory environment.  Advances in the ICT sector will provide a more enabling environment for the country's development."
