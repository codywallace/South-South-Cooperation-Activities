    "The aim of the Climate Finance Access Hub is to facilitate improved access by small and vulnerable countries to climate finance to meet their priority needs in realising sustainable development goals. To do this, the Hub will place long-term advisers at regional and national levels within small states and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to support national efforts to access and effectively use international climate finance. The work of the Climate Finance Access Hub is informed by national and regional priorities and has a strong action for South-South cooperation, exchange and mutual learning. The total value of this investment is $1.0 million to be expensed during the 2015-16 financial year."
