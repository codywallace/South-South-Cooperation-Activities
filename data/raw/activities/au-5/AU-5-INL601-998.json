    "The Special Mine Action Appeal supports activities within the ICRC preventative mine-action/weapon-contamination program and the ICRC physical rehabilitation program. The mine-action /weapon-contamination program is implemented alongside others that provides support to victims and includes a combination of information management regarding weapon contamination, risk awareness, risk reduction, capacity building and mine and explosive remnants of war clearance and survey. The physical rehabilitation program addresses the barries to accessing services faced by people with disabilities. It includes supporting national authorities in the management, development and implementation of national physical rehabilitation services; supporting service providers to ensure that they have the means to provide services; increasing and strengthening human resources for physical rehabilitation and ensuring that people have access to services."
