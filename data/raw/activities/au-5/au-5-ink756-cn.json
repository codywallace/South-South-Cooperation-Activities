    "Poverty and inequity are damaging to children's physical, emotional and spiritual development and is rarely differentiated from poverty in general, and its special dimensions have seldom been recognized. To increase awareness among developing countries of the multidimensional nature of child poverty, and promote an integrated strategic vision for child poverty reduction, UNICEF and the China's State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development propose to host a South-South Cooperation Symposium on Child Poverty in Beijing, China on 20â€“22 November 2012. The symposium will bring together 120 Chinese participants and around 40 international participants. International participants will include senior civil servants from poverty alleviation and social protection agencies in countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas, as well as noted development thinkers, to share experiences, provoke discussion and inspire action. The total value of this initiative"
