    "The Regional Pacific UXO Action Workshop will be hosted by the Australian Network to Ban Landmines and Cluster Munitions Inc (ANBLC) an Australian based non-profit organisation which works towards universalisation of the Landmine and Cluster Munitions Conventions and for providing funding and resources for land clearance, victim assistance and advocacy programs.  The workshop will increase regional and national level knowledge of the ways and means developed over the past two decades to address the problems caused by landmines, UXO and abandoned explosive ordnance, including through the development of the international legal framework and the evolution of the field of humanitarian demining and explosive ordnance disposal: and illustrate the breadth and variety of financial and technical assistance and good practice that can be employed at the national level to attract and obtain assistance. The total value of this initiative is $70,000 to be expensed during the 2012-13 financial year."
