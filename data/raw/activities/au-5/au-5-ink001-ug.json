Funding will provide referral services to mine victims and other people with disabilities; strengthen psychosocial and livelihood services for mine/explosive remnants of war (ERW) victims and other people with disabilities; conduct mine/ERW risk education; ensure advocacy, legislation and policies to meet needs of mine/ERW survivors and other people with disabilities; and conduct needs assessments focussing on refugees and internally displaced persons camps. The total value of this initiative is $2.3 million to be expensed during the 2010-11 financial year."
