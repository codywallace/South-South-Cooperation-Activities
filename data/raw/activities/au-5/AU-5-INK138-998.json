    "Funding under this initiative will support the undertaking of a mid-term review of the Mine Action Strategy 2010-2014. The mid-term review will be independent of the aid program, conducted in a participative manner with outcomes used to improve and develop Australia's mine action assistance. The objectives of the mid-term review are to review: implementation of Australia's mine action strategy and make recommendations for future engagement in mine action; and AusAID's mine action program in the Middle East. The total value of this initiative is $100,000 over 2 years, starting 2011-12."
