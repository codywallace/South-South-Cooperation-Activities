    "Funding under this initiative supports funding for Lao National Unexploded Ordnance Program (UXO Lao) and is channelled to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Trust Fund to support the implementation of the Convention of Cluster Munitions (CCM) in the Lao PDR. The UNDP administered CCM Trust Fund was established in July 2010 and has been designed as a vehicle to support the implementation of the CCM in Laos within the framework of the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness to manage and implement UXO clearance and risk education program in Laos. Support to Operations UXO Lao through the CCM Trust Fund will bring 4 key expected results: increased safety of people living in UXO-impacted communities as well as an increased amount of land available for food production and other socio-economic development activities as a result of UXO clearance; reduced risk of UXO accidents; an increased amount of land released for farming and other socio-economic development purposes through"
