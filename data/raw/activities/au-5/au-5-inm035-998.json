    "The United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation (UNSCAR) is a multi-donor flexible funding mechanism designed to fund projects aimed at supporting the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons (PoA), including South-South cooperation on assistance. To this effect, the Facility: mobilises resources to support the ratification and implementation of the ATT and the implementation of the PoA; improves effectiveness of assistance through better coordination, monitoring and matching of resources; promotes increased sustainability through more predictable sources of funding. Funding under this investment represents Australia's contribution and is valued at $0.5 million to be expensed during the 2015-16 financial year."
