    "1. In 2022, UNICEF and UNDP have continued to expand their collaboration on young people’s empowerment across Asia Pacific. The regional team concentrated on supporting the original 5 countries in the partnership (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan), while encouraging others to explore synergies. This led to more regular inter-agency communication at country level and joint events in Laos, for example. In 2022, joint initiatives have engaged 9,500+ young people and 300 local government officials through capacity building, dialogues, campaigns and consultations. \n\n- MALAYSIA country teams officially launched Phase 2 of the Youth Environmental Living Labs (YELL), piloted via UNDP-UNICEF Regional Partnership funds in 2021 and then received financial support to scale up through the Green Shark Tank Challenge. The event marked an important milestone for YELL as it convened various government Ministries, young people, and showcased investment from new private sector partners into the programme amounting. \n \n- In NEPAL, THAILAND, and PAKISTAN 2020 Seed Funds supported the development of participatory learning modules to strengthen adolescent and youth participation in local governance. In 2022, these modules were launched with government partners, including training 238 government officials in Nepal representing a constituency of 100,000 youth, 61 officials at Thailand’s Civil Society Commission and 8 local CSOs in Thailand. Municipal leaders engaged in the programme in Nepal subsequently led their first International Youth Day events at community level reaching 500 young people. In Pakistan this takes the form of the online Youth Policy Lab website, featuring 4 e-courses for young people to \n explore civic engagement pathways in Pakistan. \n \n- In LAOS, together with the regional advisors, country teams identified areas for greater collaboration, leading to joining efforts for International Youth Day. The event brought together 40 diverse young people in person and reached 6,900 online. \n \n- INDONESIA UNDP’s Youth Entrepreneurship and Green Economic Recovery research report has been completed and is about to be soft launched with public availability expected in the coming weeks. The research consulted 300+ youths from across the country in interviews, focus group discussions, and D3surveys.\n\n\n2. UNDP-UNICEF provided technical support to Thailand, Malaysia, Laos and Indonesia ranging from leading design of the regional Modules for Adolescent Participation, showcasing results through blogs, and fostering new collaborations."
