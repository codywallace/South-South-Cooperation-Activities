    "1.1 The project has been using the UNDP Corporate LTAs. It was signed a LTA for customs storage of equipment. A study on the possibility of signing LTAs for international freight was implemented and it was decided that it was not necessary to sign such LTA, as each freight has very specific needs and the competitive processes for hiring transport enterprises have been normally successful.\nSeveral other COs accomplished purchase procedures or facilitated payments in the field – this results in a more flexible and expeditious Brazilian SSC; Examples of COs that implemented or are implementing purchase procedures under request from Brazil or supporting other SSC activities: Mali, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, East-Timor, Mozambique, Cuba, São Tomé and Príncipe, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Cape Verde, Senegal, Ecuador, Timor-Leste, South Africa, Colombia, Jamaica, Argentina, Guatemala, Cuba, Bolivia, Benin, Togo, Venezuela, Uruguay, Dominican Republic\nDemands from the Brazilian Government related to purchase procedures have increased considerably; Standard Operational Procedures were produced.\n\n1.2 The relation with other UNDP’s COs have been improved and the number of COs that are supporting the Brazilian SSC has increased considerably. The project is an essential tool for operationalizing the COs support.\nThe use of corporative LTAs specially for IT Equipment and Vehicles and events has increased for sub-projects and activities in several countries.\n\n1.3 More than 140 consultants (SC, N-PSA and IC) were hired to support ABC’s activities in Brazil and abroad. \nOther professionals were hired to provide technical and administrative support to ABC project activities through companies hired by UNDP. \n\n2.1 ABC’s capacity to design and implement projects was considerably improved. With the support of this project, ABC has increased its delivery of SSC, in the scope of UNDP projects, from US$ 7.2 million in 2008 to US$ 14.5 million in 2009, and over US$ 27 million in 2010 and 2011. The SSC delivery in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was reduced due to budgetary constraints from the Brazilian Government. Despite the challenges of the Covid-19 Pandemic, and the importance of travel for SSC projects, it was possible to maintain a delivery of US$ 6.6 million in 2020. \nABC also signed partnership with other UN agencies and other partners to implement SSC projects. \nUNDP signed new cooperation projects with ABC in the field of SSC.

UNDP also implemented the project “Brazil-Africa: fighting poverty and empowering women through South-South Cooperation”, financed by DFID. One of the outcomes of the project was implemented jointly by UNDP and ABC. One of the factors that made this new project possible was the results of the project BRA/09/008. UNDP and ABC are currently preparing one new cooperation project: Project to Support Brazilian Humanitarian Actions.\n\n2.2 More than 140 consultants (SC, N-PSA and IC) were hired to support ABC’s activities in Brazil and abroad. \nOther professionals were hired to provide technical and administrative support to ABC project activities through companies hired by UNDP. \n\n2.3 The following activities were implemented by ABC with support of the project BRA/09/008:\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean: \n- 31 countries receive/have been assisted by Cooperation activities from the Brazilian Government, especially in the field of health, agriculture, environment, vocational training, education, social policies, work and employment and security.\n- 1350 cooperation actions undertaken\n- 15 Cooperation Framework Agreements signed\n- 52 Specific Agreements signed. \n- 7 MoUs signed\n\nIn Africa, Europe, Asia, and Pacific:\n- 61 countries received Cooperation from Brazil\n- 1350 cooperation actions undertaken\n- 75 specific Cooperation Agreements signed \n- 12 MOUs signed\n- 122 diagnostic missions undertaken\n- 17 Cooperation Framework Agreements Signed\n- 27 technical consultancy products analyzed\n\nABC’s capacity for elaborating, monitoring and evaluation projects was considerably strengthened and the following publications and guidelines were issued: Guidelines for Technical Missions, Guidelines for the Management of SSC projects (institutionalizes by specific legislation), CPLP Guidelines for Projects, Guidelines for reporting results of missions; ABC’s consultants and staff were trained in RBM.
