It has benefitted to 7155 persons 2817 women 2818 men 711 girls and 809 boys  see section Activity 1.1.4 below. The EOD teams have also encountered UXOs that were not previously inventoried See example in Annex 2 and contributed to enlarge the database of all UXO ever found in the Lao PDR. The discovery of landmines in the district was also an opportunity for HI to address the relatively new issues linked to landmines threat among the UXO sector and to contribute more broadly to improve safety of UXO operators.A total of 5864 Explosive Ordnances have been safely disposed in the district thanks to the activities of all the EOD components NTS TS Area Clearance and Roving team 15 large aircraft bombs 3734 cluster munitions 30 landmines and 2085 other explosive remnants of war.Increased the capacity building for 8 staff of PNRA and DLSW on IMSMA DIT GALS and  QM this including materials supported to PNRA office The project also answered specific requests from the district authorities and supported the district socioeconomic development plan by clearing 4 schools and one hospital nonCHA clearance directly contributing to highimpact areas.Through a contextspecific and tailored strategy for each of the target villages the knowledge behaviors and practices toward the UXO and landmines risk were improved.

According to the postimpact assessment See Annex 4 conducted in 2021 the level of participation in risk education was 97 compared to 72.7 during the baseline see Annex 3. 43 villages established Community Based Risk Management CBRM Focal Points which developed and implemented action plan related to the risk of UXO and landmines. Volunteers were also trained on first aid as part of the communitybased first aid model of intervention increasing the response in case of emergency UXO or nonUXO related accidents.Risk Education activities reached 11762 people  including 3891 women 3819 men 1995 girls and 2057 boys. 55 teachers from 45 schools were trained observing 80 improvement in students knowledge on the UXO riskHI has directly implemented the disability data collection in 44 villages and identified 880 persons with disabilities 373 women 507 women and disseminates information on the number sex age situation needs and capacities of victims.
