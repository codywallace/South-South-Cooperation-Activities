    "STARLIT targets the maize value chain (VC) in the Kayonza area in Rwanda and in Kakamega county, Kenya. Kayonza  is a remote and drought prone area in Eastern Rwanda. The Kayonza smallholder farmers experience major challenges in accessing agricultural finance, (urban) markets, agricultural information, technology and mechanization. Since its first cases were found in East Africa around March 2020, COVID-19 worsened the situation. According to an internal study on the impact of the pandemic on market actors in Rwanda in August 2020, “access to inputs, market and extension services was limited by movement and transport restrictions. For example, the inability to travel to the market in Kigali in person (due to restrictions) to safeguard the quality of inputs, was seen as particularly challenging”. Although these restrictions have since been lifted, the negative impact on farmers’ income is felt and will continue to be felt in the coming seasons.  \nSTARLIT aligns with China-IFAD South-South Cooperation Facility through supporting rural productivity, access to markets, increased income and food security and promoting South-South learning",
    "STARLIT aims to strengthen the resilience of farmers in the context of prolonged disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  It supports farmers to recover from the impact of COVID-19 by facilitating access to digital agriculture information, financial services, markets and mechanization.",
    "STARLIT aims to directly benefit 2,800 smallholder farmers (45% women, 40% youth) working in cereal VCs in Rwanda and Kenya. \n\nIn Rwanda, STARLIT will directly benefit 2,000 maize smallholder farmers facilitated to access digital market information, digital extension services and financial services in the Kayonza district. In Kenya, the project will benefit 800 maize farmers in the western Kenya county of Kakamega.  The selected farmers are located in a remote part of the district, with challenges in accessing agricultural finance, connecting to (urban) markets and accessing agricultural information, technology and mechanization. COVID -19 worsened their situations due to restricted movements and lockdown."
