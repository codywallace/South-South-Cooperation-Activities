    "The Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group under the UN\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) includes 47\nstates that are particularly vulnerable to climate change but have\ncontributed the least to the problem. LDC Group members face\nchallenges in the UNFCCC process due to limited resources and\ncapacity, which result from small delegation size. The Group relies\non external assistance in strengthening engagement in climate\nnegotiations, national-level capacity-building, and knowledge sharing\nthrough South-South cooperation.\nGGGI’s Climate Diplomacy Program gave voice to the LDC\nGroup by supporting them to actively participate in the UNFCCC\nnegotiations through technical assistance in preparing for the\nnegotiations and a research program to identify and address LDC\nGroup capacity gaps. The Program was to be implemented in close\ncooperation with the LDC Group Chair and members, as well as\nother LDC Group partners, to support two of the three pillars of\nthe LDC Group Work Plan: building on ongoing GGGI technical\nassistance, capacity building, and research and analysis programs.\nGGGI’s work is complementary to that of the International\nInstitute for Environment and Development (IIED) and Climate\nAnalytics (CA). GGGI is unique among the current support team\nin that the organization has teams embedded in Ministries in 11\nLDC Group member countries, undertaking programs to support\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement at the national level.",
