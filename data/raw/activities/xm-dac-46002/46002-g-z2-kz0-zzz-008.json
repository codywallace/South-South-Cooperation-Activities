    "The main objective of the NEPAD led regional event held in Tunis in November 2010 was to build consensus on African positions on development effectiveness and to prepare for the High Level Forum IV in Busan, South Korea in 2011. The event was instrumental in reshaping the thinking on the overall global development architecture which is expected to impact the policy design and implementation on a proposed African aid architecture based on innovative financing. In this regard, the event succeeded in formulating a position on issues of ownership and accountability; south/south cooperation; capacity building; strengthening of country systems; regional perspectives on development effectiveness.\nApproved: CAD 106,060 (92% disbursed and balance is being returned to the TCA)."
