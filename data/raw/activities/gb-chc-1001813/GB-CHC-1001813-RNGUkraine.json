    "Survey teams will conduct all non-technical survey activities, explosive ordnance disposal, risk assessments and socio-economic assessments. The team may conduct limited risk education in relation to specific hazardous areas on an ad-hoc basis. The team outputs will be as follows: - Non-technical survey, marking and reporting of newly identified hazards - Cancellation of previously recorded areas, if necessary - Mine/ERW risk assessments on behalf of third parties - Explosive Ordnance Disposal (on a call-out basis from members of the public) - Community liaison before and after clearance, including pre- and post-clearance socio-economic assessments Manual clearance teams will conduct clearance and technical survey of hazardous areas, containing anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines, IEDs on tripwires, cluster munitions and other ERW. The outputs of the manual clearance team will be either area cleared (mine clearance and battle area clearance) or area reduced by technical survey, in reference to the International Mine Action Standard on Land Release."

    "Under this project, The HALO Trust will deliver a community-centred survey and clearance programme to support the humanitarian and early recovery needs of populations affected by mines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) in eastern Ukraine resulting from the ongoing conflict. This element of HALO’s global project will be implemented over 24 months in Years 3 and 4 of the project in anticipation of an application for emergency funds to cover activities in Ukraine until that date. This project will build on a Dutch Government grant to HALO in 2015-16 which was used to establish HALO’s programme in Ukraine, and directly led to the first non-technical survey and clearance operations in the country by an international NGO.",
    "Over 24 months, HALO will deploy two demining teams and one Community Outreach Risk Education (CORE) team with Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) capabilities, comprising a total of 31 local personnel. In alignment with Dutch Government SRoL overarching goal, this project will involve citizens of Ukraine in peacebuilding processes in an effort to promote legitimate stability in order to lay the foundation for sustainable development. Clearance, survey and risk assessment activity is designed to engage local people in the rebuilding and reconstruction process, and will focus on facilitating the repair of critical infrastructure and clearance of farmland, as well as ensuring the safe return of displaced families. By making safe agricultural land available and providing safe access for repair of critical infrastructure, this project will increase economic opportunities in eastern Ukraine and thereby reduce the draw to further violence or engagement in illegal trafficking. The overall impact of this project will be to contribute to the three over-arching policy impacts of: space for inclusive development, sustained conditions for human security, and increase resilience and ability to cope with shocks. The removal of hazardous items directly improves safety, while the economic and livelihood opportunities either restored or created by clearance of land improve overall human security in affected areas. The return of IDPs to safe areas, with economic opportunities provided by clearance, will lead to more resilient communities inclined to engage with efforts toward peace.",
    "Throughout the project the programme will collect internal operational data and IMSMA (International Management System for Mine Action) data forms for submission to the national IMSMA database (primarily non-technical survey reports, land release reports, and accident data). Internal operational data is collected electronically using tablets and synchronised to a database. IMSMA implementation has only just begun in Ukraine, and currently the limited data set provides little of interest to third parties. Military and security restrictions may restrict the areas covered by the data, and until the development of a National Mine Action Centre, national resources for disseminating the data are not available. Rather than providing potentially incomplete raw data sets to actors beyond the Mine Action community, the survey team provided by this project is able to conduct risk assessments of areas of interest for projects implemented by national or international organisations and government bodies. In the longer term, the HALO Trust will assist in dissemination of IMSMA, as it has done in Cambodia with the development of a publicly accessible web map showing IMSMA data."

The survey team will be composed of four personnel conducting non technical survey, gathering information from the local population, and identifying suspected and confirmed hazardous area. In addition, the team will respond to Explosive Ordnance Demolition call-outs received from local population. HALO will also have a total of 26 personnel broken down into two mine clearance teams, which will be deployed based on a programme agreed with the National Mine Action Authority, local Governments and HALO."

    "1. The MRE pre- and post-training questionnaires include one question assessing respondents; feeling of safety. The pre-training questionnaire measures respondents' current feeling of safety with regard to the mine threat [question: how safe do you feel in your village in relation to the mine threat?]. The post-training questionnaire assesses the change in respondents' feeling of safety following MRE [question: Did the mine risk education lesson affect your feeling of safety in your village with regard to mines and other ammunition?]. In February-March 2018 HALO Ukraine surveyed a 50% sample of beneficiaries at 5 MRE sessions in the buffer zone in Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The sample of 161 respondents was made up of 87 boys aged 10-18 and 74 girls between the ages of 10 and 18 years old. Pre-test responses showed that 34% of respondents felt somewhat or very unsafe due to the mine threat, and 30% felt neutral. Post-test surveys showed that 48% of them felt safer after receiving the MRE session, while 29% felt less safe after the session. This is probably linked to an increased understanding of the potential mine hazards in their settlement, where they were not previously aware of the danger. For feelings of safety linked to clearance, HALO has conducted a baseline survey with 120 inhabitants of mine-affected settlements, mostly direct beneficiaries. The baseline survey enquired about their feeling of safety in relation to the mine threat in their home, at work, or at their employees' places of work. 46% of respondents answered that they feel very unsafe due to the mine threat in their home, and an additional 32% responded that they feel somewhat unsafe. It is anticipated that 35% of clearance beneficiaries will feel safer upon completion of clearance in their settlements. The Ukraine programme has only been conducting clearance for two years, and as such no post-clearance assessments have yet been carried out. For this reason, this target is based on a synthesis of similar targets from other HALO programmes, and actual results may vary from this forecasted figure.The baseline value is set at 0, as none of the beneficiaries surveyed have yet gained access to land cleared as part of this project.",
    "Several NGOs provide MRE in Ukraine and have been doing so since 2015. For this reason, the level of mine threat awareness across population in Eastern Ukraine is already quite high, and many participants of HALO MRE sessions have previously received MRE from other providers. The IMAS Mine Risk Education Best Practice Guidebook explains that mine MRE messages need to be reiterated and reinforced for children on a regular basis to ensure their continued consideration of the risks, and as such it is to be expected and even commended that beneficiaries are cognizant of some MRE messages before the start of the session. During the course of the Dutch grant, HALO will endeavour to reach less informed settlements, companies and schools. However, it is inevitable that some of these attendees will have received MRE messages before, which will affect the results of pre- and post-training tests.HALO conducted pre- and post-training tests to create a baseline survey for increased knowledge following Risk Education. The sample size was 25% of attendees at each MRE session. The baseline survey also acted as a pilot for the knowledge questionnaires which will be distributed throughout the grant period. The pre- and post-training tests consist of 8 questions designed to measure increased knowledge of ERW/mines. The test assesses understanding of the types of objects and locations that can pose a threat, the injuries and damage that ERW can cause, and what resources are available to call upon if a suspicious item is found. In February-March 2018 5 MRE sessions were surveyed, and a total of 161 beneficiaries took part in the survey. The sample included 87 boys and 74 girls. All children were between 10 and 18 years old. Following MRE, 36% more students were able to correctly name potentially hazardous areas, while 37% more students were able to identify potentially hazardous places from photographs.",
    "HALO's pre- and post-MRE training tests assess the change in people's intended behaviour when faced with an explosive item or hazardous area following risk education. Four questions included in the test ask participants what action they would take in the face of a mine or if they found themselves in a minefield. Although intended behaviour cannot be considered a direct reflection of a respondent's actual behaviour in a future real-life situation, it serves as an indication of change in attitude, and thus intention towards safe behaviour. This does not take into consideration those beneficiaries who may be forced to travel through a minefield for essential resources or access.In February-March 2018 101 participants answered questions on safe behaviour in 3 MRE sessions (following a pilot of the survey in two sessions). The sample included 54 boys and 47 girls. All children were between 10 and 18 years old. Following MRE, there was a 20% increase in understanding of safe behaviour when confronted with unexploded ordnance, and a 9% increase in answers demonstrating intended safe behaviour when dealing with a suspicious-looking item in a public place. As HALO does not currently have a license to destroy munitions in Ukraine, HALO's Mine Risk Education advises the general public to call the State Emergency Services of Ukraine if they come across an item of ERW. For this reason, EOD call-out statistics would not be an accurate representation of the efficacy of HALO's MRE. For this reason, HALO has requested data from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine outlining the number of EOD callouts received each month since the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  So far, these statistics show that the number of people reporting hazardous items has increased constantly over the past four years: 13% of all requests were received in 2014 and 2015, 31% in 2016, and 43% in 2017. This demonstrates that overall, the population of eastern Ukraine is increasingly demonstrating safe behaviour.  Although this increase in safe behaviour correlates with the timeframe in which HALO has been providing MRE in eastern Ukraine, HALO's contribution to this increased safe behaviour is not clearly definable from these statistics, as several other MRE providers also work in the region. To address this, HALO will request more granular data from the State Emergency Services for the districts in which HALO conducts Mine Risk Education during the grant period which, it is anticipated, will show the an increase in EOD callout figures for areas that receive MRE during the year. If HALO is granted an explosives license during the grant period, HALO's own EOD callout figures will be used for this indicator.",
    "Baseline data for this indicator was collected during the non-technical survey (NTS) stage of HALO's work. Survey teams discuss anticipated land use with local authorities and potential direct beneficiaries of clearance in each settlement. NTS teams also assess the threat types present in the settlement, and create maps of the tasks that require clearance. Land use types in Ukraine are determined by the government, and are thus not frequently subject to change. For this reason, it is very likely that actual land use once a task has been cleared will be consistent with the declared anticipated land use prior to clearance, at least in the medium term of a few years following clearance. However, in some instances land may be used in a different manner to that which was initially declared, for example where economic trends or security incidents cause beneficiaries to leave. For this reason, baseline land use data should only be considered as anticipated land use.HALO plans to deploy Dutch-funded clearance teams onto predominantly arable tasks during 2018. 95% of land contained in the Dutch workplan for the year is arable land (2,634,593 sq.m), while 2.5% is forested area (70,050 sq.m), and the rest is designated for other purposes (70,734 sq.m). Post-clearance land use will be assessed between 6 and 12 months following land release, taking into account seasonal activities such as sowing, harvesting or foraging.The baseline for land use is set at 0. It is assumed that communities will not use land while it is contaminated with mines.",
    "HALO's survey teams interviewed 120 households as part of the baseline survey, of which 93% were direct beneficiaries of tasks on which Dutch-funded clearance teams are likely to work in 2018-19. 79% of respondents were of working age (19-60 years old) while 21% were retired. 33% of respondents were female, roughly in keeping with the gender balance of HALO Ukraine's adult beneficiaries, of whom 60% are male and 40% are female.Data gathered as part of the baseline survey included details of beneficiary household income and the impact of mines and other ERW on their livelihoods. Beneficiaries were asked about losses to their income as a result of mined land, for example the impact on harvests and agricultural production or on foraging for foods to sell. Beneficiaries who described themselves as the owner, manager, or head of a business were asked additional questions regarding changes to their staff needs as a result of the mine threat. 71% of respondents reported that the presence of mines in their settlement had a negative or strongly negative impact on their household income. 42% of beneficiary households reported their monthly  income as $105-175. The average household size is 2.69 people, putting the average income per individual at $39-65 per month. Almost all respondents who reported their monthly income as falling into this bracket reported that they did not earn enough money to meet their needs. Land owners, farmers and managers in agricultural companies surveyed (7% of respondents) all reported that at least some of the land owned by their farms/agricultural companies was contaminated with mines or other ERW. The extent to which their land was reportedly contaminated ranged from 1% to 100%. These respondents indicated that once this land is released, they intend to use it either to grow crops, graze animals, or plant a market garden. 2.5% of respondents were high level forestry employees, who had used forested areas as their main source of income before the conflict. All of these respondents reported that at least some (between 40% and 100%) of the forested land they or their company had previously used is now contaminated with ERW/mines. These respondents indicated that, once cleared, they or their company intends to use the land for wood-cutting or as a hunting ground.It is anticipated that clearance of explosive hazards from agricultural land will lead to increased agricultural production and thus improved livelihoods. Clearance of forested areas is expected to enable increased income generating activity through woodcutting, foraging and hunting, thus improving livelihoods. However, wider economic trends or conflict-related developments may also affect beneficiaries' ability or willingness to use cleared land, with a knock-on effect on livelihoods improvement.",
    "The baseline survey contained two two-part questions assessing the effect of mines and other ERW on access to basic services and community infrastructure such as churches and parks. The results of the survey showed that before clearance, 12% of respondents have limited or blocked access to at least one basic service. Limited access to electricity and drinking water  were the most commonly reported service restrictions. Additionally, 75% of respondents reported that they have limited or blocked access to community infrastructure, with 55% of respondents reporting limited or blocked access to aspects of community life that they use habitually, and 20% reporting reduced access to infrastructure that they would use less regularly.It is anticipated that clearance of land around items of infrastructure will improve access to these items for direct beneficiaries.",
    "Pre-clearance interviews and non-technical survey visits to settlements included in the 2018 clearance workplan documented the number of accidents that had occurred in or near the minefields planned for clearance. Survey teams recorded 12 such accidents with a total of 24 casualties. The task most affected by mine accidents was in Teple, where 14 people were killed or injured by mines and other ERW in 4 accidents since 2014.  The baseline assessment conducted for this project in January-February 2018 revealed that 14 respondents (12%) or members of their families had experienced some form of mine/ERW accident in the past four years. The post-clearance assessment will be carried out at least six months after land release and will show that HALO has removed explosive hazards from the land, preventing future casualties.HALO also maintains a database of mine accidents covering the period from May 2014 until the present day, to monitor trends in accident frequency and casualty details. The highest number of accidents took place in 2015, when the majority of  minefields had been laid, but the civilian population was not well-informed about the threat that mines posed. Since November 2015 the average number of civilian casualties per month has been slowly decreasing, as a result of MRE and minefield marking by NGOs, mine clearance, and increased general awareness about hazardous areas among local populations. To date, there have been 1,847 civilian and military casualties from mines and ERW in eastern Ukraine. Provided that security situation does not change significantly, the downward trend should continue over the year."

    "Due to harsh weather conditions during the winter, manual clearance teams could not be deployed to the field in January and most of February. The time available was dedicated to various training courses and refresher training courses. Since the ground was still frozen during most of this reporting period, clearance teams were deployed mostly on sites requiring surface and sub-surface battle area clearance. However, since this type of threat is limited, when the weather conditions improved, the teams worked on mixed-threat minefields requiring two-stage clearance resulting in lower outputs.",
    "During this period, the Dutch-funded teams continued to work on mixed-threat minefields requiring slower two-stage clearance and on minefields containing minimum-metal anti-vehicle mines. Both types of threat require complex clearance techniques resulting in lower outputs than originally anticipated. However, since HALO Ukraine is trialling new methods of tripwire preparation using a remotely controlled vegetation cutting machine and a new type of detector on the minefields containing minimum metal mines, the clearance rates are expected to improve in the upcoming period.",
    "Due to good weather conditions, new methods of tripwire preparation using a remote controlled vegetation cutter, as well as clearance on less challenging tasks, the clearance rates continued to increase during the reporting period, resulting in a large area of land released. Nevertheless, clearance continued to be limited by work on mixed-threat minefields that required  labour-intensive tripwire preparation followed by sub-surface clearance.",
    "Clearance rates were lower than the previous quarter due to cold temperatures and the need to conduct labour-intensive tripwire clearance on several high-priority tasks. Although HALO Ukraine deployed two remote controlled vegetation cutters in order to speed up this process, they could not be deployed on mixed-threat tasks.",
