    "Most land worked on this quarter will be released to beneficiaries  for agricultural and residential (housing) purposes.",
    "In this quarter, the surface of land cleared significantly increased from the previous quarter, due to the deployment of additional teams compared to the previous quarter. Most land worked in this quarter will be released to communities for agricultural purposes.",
    "In this quarter, the number of teams deployed was lower in comparison to the previous quarter because of security and access limitations. The surface cleared in this quarter does not exceed the surface cleared in the previous quarter due to significant security and access issues in the context of the collapse of the former government, which significantly hampered our ability to deploy to several tasks for two weeks in August.",
    "In the last quarter of 2021 HALO was able to deploy additional teams to support clearance on this project, this was partially to ensure recoverly of lost productivity throughout the summer months due to the instabiltiy in Afghanistan. Most of the land cleared was released for agricultural and residential use.",
    "HALO has overachieved the cancellation target set for 2021 by over 40%. As mentioned in previous submission, cancellation targets are set as per historical averages and areas and so therefore, fluctuations in achievement are to be expected.",
    "Cancellation targets are based on historical averages of land cancelled by the CORE team in a month. However, the areas surveyed by the CORE team are selected on an ad hoc basis, and it is not possible to predict in advance how much of the land can be cancelled. As such, achievements are unpredictable.",
    "There was no cancellation this quarter. Targets are calculated using historical averages for the area a CORE team resurveys or cancels in a normal month, extrapolated across the entire project period. It is not possible to be more specific as these are often conducted by the CORE team as additional activities when attending community call-outs",
    "Cancellations targets are based on historical averages of land cancelled by the CORE team in a month. The areas surveyed are selected randomly, thus cancellation achievements cannot be predicted.",

It is not possible to be more specific as these are often conducted by the CORE team as additional activities when attending community call-outs",
    "In line with the increased clearance productivity experienced in the final quarter of 2021, HALO teams were also able to cancel a far greater amount of land due to increased team deployments.",
    "Cancellation metrics are unpredictable and therefore are often over or underreached.",
    "Teams worked on a very large BAC task in Hairatan in Balkh. BAC clearance is generally faster than mine clearance or AIM clearance, and so high land clearance achievements were reached rapidly.",
    "The HMA teams worked on 6 tasks in Baklh and Baghlan provinces this quarter, and the AIM teams worked on 3 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.",
    "The AIM teams worked in Nangarhar province while the mechanical demining units and manual demining teams worked in Baghlan and Balkh provinces this quarter.",
    "The HMA teams worked during this quarter in the provinces of Kabul, Balkh, Samangan and Parwan provinces. More specifically, AIM teams worked in the province of Nangarhar this quarter while mechanical demining units worked in Samangan and Balkh provinces.",

    "This quarter, mechanical teams worked on tasks in Towz Bulaq village, Kaldar district of Balkh province",
    "In this quarter, mechanical teams worked on tasks in Samangan and Balkh provinces.",
    "Mechanical teams productivty increased in line with clearance outputs.",
    "EOD call-outs take place based on community demand, as such numbers of EOD call-outs cannot easily be projected. Targets were set according to historical trends.",
    "The teams are on track to over-achieve the EOD call-out target for this year. This activity is subject to demand and as such it is not possible to predict accurately how many call-outs will take place.",
    "The teams are still on track to over-achieve the EOD call-out target for this year.",
    "The teams have over-achieved the EOD call-out target for this year in this quarter.",

However, the areas surveyed by the CORE team are selected on an ad hoc basis, whilst attending community call-outs, and cannot be planned in advance. As such, achievements are unpredictable. They also resurvey all the tasks on the workplan for the project, so once these are complete resurvey area achievements may level off slightly.",

    "Large swathes of new contamination or unrecorded contamination was surveyed during this quarter. This is partially due to better access, as well as the scale of IED contaminaton being found in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand.",
    "This quarter HALO has revised the re-survey target for the full contract period from 6,600,000 sqm to 20,600,000 sqm, given that we achieved 400% of the original 2021 target in the last quarter.",

HALO based their EORE target on DMAC guidance at the time, where sessions were previously limited to single households or groups of no more than five people. However, the DMAC guidance has since been updated so EORE sessions may include single households or groups of up to fifteen people. Therefore, HALO is overachieving on total number of EORE beneficiaries reached.",
