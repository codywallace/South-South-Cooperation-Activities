    "This project will provide immediate protection from the threat of mines and ERW for 30,532 vulnerable Afghans living in five provinces of Afghanistan, directly contributing to human security in 24 mine-impacted rural communities (Dutch Government Security and Rule of Law (SRoL)Policy Sub-Goal 1.1). The project will clear 441.5 hectares of land, destroy 30 tonnes of explosive ammunition, and provide support to 144 mine/ERW accident victims. It will contribute to wider stability and human security in the surrounding areas and therefore to the stability of Afghanistan as a whole.",
    "HALO’s work will offer four immediate benefits: physical protection, providing employment for the rural poor, assistance for victims of mine/ERW accidents, and improving rural livelihoods. Physical protection will be provided through three main activities: mine clearance, Mine Risk Education (MRE) and Weapons and Ammunition Disposal (WAD). These activities will be conducted by staff recruited from mine-impacted areas, who will be employed on a long-term basis to create security for their own communities, as specified in SRoL Sub-Goal 1.3.",
    "The project represents a significant investment in lives and livelihoods in rural communities neglected by many NGOs due to lack of funding and poor security, where all indicators for human security are poor, economic opportunities are few, and the government is unable to guarantee security. The project will also contribute to human security in a wider sense through increasing social stability and cohesion in the target communities. Migration from Afghanistan’s rural areas, driven by unemployment and instability, can be reduced by addressing these two issues through large-scale mine clearance and WAD work. The project will offer livelihoods opportunities: the majority of land cleared will be used for grazing, foraging, or crop cultivation, representing a vital source of income for members of rural mine-impacted communities. Of the total funding requested, HALO will provide funding to a local partner organisation, Accessibility Organisation for Afghan Disabled (AOAD), in a project which will deliver critical assistance to victims of mine and ERW accidents in the target communities, who are often excluded from political, economic, and social opportunities due to their disabilities."

Balk has an abundance of agricultural land and many farmers keep livestock, mostly cattle. Although security incidents do happen, Balkh is not an active conflict province.",
    "Baghlan province is located in the North of Afghanistan linking central and northern regions with the Hindu Kush mountain range, a central feature. The capital, Puli-Khumri sits 1,700 metres above sea level. Baghlan has insecure areas, particularly in Tala wa Barfak, but HALO's reputation and excellent community liaison mitigates against any risk to deminers.",
    "Khaki Jabbar of Kabul province is a primarily mountainous district 25km South East of the capital. Communities live at the bottom of the mountains and generally own livestock, using the land for grazing, pastures and collecting firewood. The working conditions can be remote and clearance tasks far from roads or villages.",

Many refugees from Pakistan travel across the border and settle in Gulan refugee camp or within the host communities. Refugees and returnees entering Khost from Pakistan have little knowledge of the history of the land and contamination. MRE provides vital life-safing information in an area with heavy displacement and movement.",

Clearance here may be more time consuming around residential buildings. Laghman province was not in the original proposal, has been added due to a reduced number of tasks in Khost, another donor was allocated tasks in Khost due to insecurities in Paktya",

    "Samangan province is located north of the Hindu Kush mountains in the Northern region of Afghanistan. Agriculture and small scale mining are the primary livelihoods. The main crops grown are wheat, barley and potato and flax. Demining will take place in the hilly and mountainous areas of the province."

Teams were able to clear at a faster than expected rate because of low metal contamination in tasks, especially those located in the Ruyi du Ab district of Samangan province. HALO Afghanistan has been able to take advantage of these favourable ground conditions and add more large area tasks to the work plan to overachieve on clearance targets.",
    "In 2020, manual and mechanical clearance led to the release of 659,278 square metres of contaminated land. This was 89% of the overall target for the year; combined with the outputs of battle area clearance, teams met 175% of this target (see below).",
    "As a result of security risks in Khaki Jabbar district of Kabul province, NL funded teams in the area were relocated to Laghman province, where they were provided with new tasks. As the tasks in Laghman were smaller, the number of tasks was increased to ensure the annual target of clearance would be achieved.",

This quarter, changes to the workplan were made to accommodate the visit of the Dutch Foreign Minister. The number of tasks was revised to from 19 to 21. The tasks are larger than those on the previous workplan, resulting in approximately the same amount of land being cleared. As such, no adjustments to the clearance target are necessary.",

    "As was the trend in previous quarters, the number of indirect beneficiaries significantly overachieved the overall project target. The reason is that the data of minefields and beneficiaries were collected several years prior to the actual mine clearance activities. The overall project target was thus based on outdated data. During the time gap between survey and clearance, the number of beneficiaries have increased (due to general population growth, IDPs, etc..). To better account for the number of indirect beneficiaries, the target for 2018 will be revised.",
    "Fewer indirect beneficiaries were reached this project year as a result of changes in the workplan. The targets are based on the previous workplan. The changes were the result of the Dutch Foreign Minister visiting HALO tasks in Mazar-i-Sharif in June 2018, where the Dutch funded demining teams were allocated to host the visit. Additionally, beneficiary numbers are often based on outdated data recorded in the IMSMA database.

This is due to the fact that most of the beneficiaries surveyed in 2018 live next to roads that used to be mined. After clearance, most beneficiaries were able to benefit from cleared roads and other beneficiaries had increased access to other services and infrastructure. The initial target was based on the number of beneficiaries that reported blocked access to services and infrastructure during the baseline. However, changes in the workplan occurred and different communities were included in the livelihoods survey. Likewise, even though direct access might not have been block by mines, they might have easier and shorter travelling distance to other areas.",

Teams were able to clear at a faster than expected rate because of low metal contamination in tasks, especially those located in the Ruyi du Ab district of Samangan province. HALO Afghanistan has been able to take advantage of these favourable ground conditions and add more large area tasks to the work plan to overachieve on clearance targets.",
    "In 2020, manual and mechanical clearance led to the release of 659,278 square metres of contaminated land. This was 89% of the overall target for the year; combined with the outputs of battle area clearance, teams met 175% of this target (see below).",
