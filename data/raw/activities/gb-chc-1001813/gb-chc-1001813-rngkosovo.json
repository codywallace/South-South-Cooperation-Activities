For the Battle area clearance of cluster munitions, HALO will use sub-surface clearance techniques combining the use of Large Loop metal detectors (LLDs) in open areas such as agricultural fields and Schoenstedt magnetic locators where the LLD can not work effectovely such as dense forest. When conducting clearance of minefields the teams will use the latest clearance techniques and technologies such as linear clearance with dual sesnor detectors (in Kosovo HALO uses HSTAMIDS)."

    "HALO is funded to deliver a 48-month project in Kosovo with a total cost of $763,208 to clear minefields and NATO cluster munition strikes. $381,604 is being provided by the Dutch Government to conduct landmine and cluster munitions clearance. This will be matched by a private donor committed to providing matched funding to HALO for the clearance of all remaining minefields in the country.",
    "It is proposed that the project will release the following land: - 3 NATO cluster munition strikes covering 160,000m², and 10 minefields covering 262,000m²",
    "To achieve the outputs, the total project, including match funding, will employ 14 Kosovan national staff divided into two seven-person demining teams. Over four years, it is estimated that the project will support 191 direct and 3,323 indirect beneficiaries."

    "Many of the minefields left to clear are located on agricultural land and woodland in rural, remote areas of Kosovo. Landmines were laid extensively during the war in Kosovo in the late 1990s by former Yugoslav forces, which resulted in substantial contamination and thereby restricted access to agricultural land and woodlands.Towards the end of the Kosovo War, NATO bombed Yugoslav targets over a period of 78 days in 1999; hundreds of thousands of sub-munitions were dropped from cluster bombs during this campaign. Both American-made BLU-97s and British-made BLU-755s were dropped throughout Kosovo. An estimated 20% of all cluster munitions dropped failed to activate, leaving rural areas in the country littered with unexploded sub-munitions."

    "All beneficiary numbers have been updated for 2018 following the completion of the baseline survey through which HALO Kosovo has gathered more accurate beneficiary data. 2018 targets for beneficiary numbers were not reached due to geographical factors of cleared land less amenable to high beneficiary numbers. However, HALO has already surpassed the total contract target of beneficiaries due to prioritisation of land clearance in 2017, which yielded higher beneficiary numbers",
    "Beneficiary numbers are determined by task selection. Task selection was agreed after the submission of the 2019 annual plan. The beneficiary targets listed here were determined in 2020 with KMAC once tasks were selected.",
    "As reported last quarter, the programme has revised the method it uses to calculate direct and indirect beneficiaries, resulting in higher direct beneficiaries number in general. However the particular BAC task which received clearance in 2020 by HALO is a public park in the centre of Peja city with thousands of direct beneficiaries. This task was not in HALO's original work plan for this project. However, due to Covid, the programme was restricted as to where teams could operate and the team directed clearance at this task because it remained accessible during this time.",
