    "The HALO West Bank programme is funded to remove the threat of mines and UXO from nine minefields in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank) laid by the Jordanian military prior to the 1967 war, which impact upon the lives of Palestinian civilians today. This project is contributing, together with three other donors (United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom) to clearance of seven minefields between September 2016 and August 2018, using equipment, infrastructure and a management team already in place. The programme is working under the coordination of the Israeli National Mine Action Authority (INMAA), and the Palestinian Mine Action Authority (PMAC).",
    "For the community members living close to the minefields: a) immediate improvement in human security through removal of the threat, reducing to zero the potential for future violent injury; b) improvement in economic livelihood opportunities through releasing fallow agricultural land on which crops can be grown. For sustainable peace and stability in the West Bank: c) potential access to source of explosives is denied through safe removal of mines and ordnance; d) effective humanitarian mine action, jointly coordinated by INMAA and PMAC encourages dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian entities, in particular strengthening capacity and credibility of a PA institution.",
    "The seven minefields are on predominantly agricultural land which, once cleared, will reduce violence against citizens, and contribute to the safety and economic security of the landowners and surrounding communities. 419 people will benefit directly and 58,915 benefit indirectly from land released. Land released and put back into productive use will lead to socio-economic and livelihood improvements; 76% of land released will be for agriculture, 24% for renovation of infrastructure.",
    "Funding from the Netherlands Government and diplomatic support through the Representative Office in Ramallah and the Embassy in Tel Aviv played an important role in helping establish the HALO West Bank programme in 2012. The first clearance took place in April 2014. Israeli mandated Quality Assurance of all programme clearance is entirely funded by the United States. Support through this grant sends a relevant message of continued Netherlands commitment to impacted Palestinian communities."

While existence of the minefields is known to landowners and nearby Palestinian community members, the sites are poorly fenced and marked, and people frequently stray on to the contaminated ground. Although no database exists and some information is only anecdotal, there has been a small but steady number of explosive incidents resulting in injury and death to adults, children and animals for fifty years (1967 - 2017). The goal of removing the threat posed to Palestinian civilians will be achieved through completon of mine clearance.",
