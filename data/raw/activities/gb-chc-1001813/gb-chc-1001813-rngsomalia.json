    "Phase 1: Manual mine clearance involves the employment of many demininer to manually clear all suspect areas (ie lands and roads) that is not accessible to mechanical equipment. Manual demining team are equiped with Minelab F3s detectors and are also conducting full excavation depending on the caracterisitc of the tasks worked on. Manual deminers are working on seven lanes at a time and are supervised by a Section Commander. The section commander ensures 100% of Quality Assurance (QA) while the task supervisor is responsible for 25% of the QA. A romaning QA team is also responsable for overseing the assesments made by the sections commanders and the supervisors. Mechanical mine clearance has been a very efficient clearance strategy in Somaliland. Mechanical assests are deployed - when land allows it - on areas where manual clerance wil be too timely. Mechanical and survey teams are considered as programme assets and will be used for general HALO operations. In Somaliland, one team is funded under this project. The RNG funded team uses a front end loader to pursue its work. Phase 2: in Phase 2, HALO will transfer its mine clearance activities from Somaliland to Southern Somalia. Moreover, HALO will deploy one mobile CORE/EOD team that will: 1) survey rural locations next to the Ethiopian border, 2) seach and destroy items of UXOs, 3) resurvey hazardous areas to increase knowledge on the nature of the contmination in the region and register its findings to IMSMA 4) conduct EOD Call-Outs tasks when required. Risk Education (RE) sessions will also be conducted by the CORE/EOD team and, at times, the mine clearance teams. The objective will be to increase awareness of the local populations on the risks related to mines and ERW."

    "Somalia is in the process of transitioning from a 'failed' to a 'fragile' state with central and recognised governemental institutions. To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALOâ€™s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",
    "This project's activities will directly generate outcomes relevant to the Dutch Government's Policy on Security and Rule of Law (SRoL) in fragile states through the following two objectives: 1) Tackle immediate threat to human lives and livelihoods of landmine and UXO through communit-based manuyal clerance and EOD; 2) Contribute to improved country stability and regional security in highly volatile and insecure environment through a large-scale and meaningful employmnet focused project.",
    "Through a 'community-based demining' approach, HALO targets the most at risk and vulnerable communities. This means that during pahse two deminers will be recruited from the very communities that are affected by landmines and UXO. The objective is to trigger local ownership of the issue and empowerment and stabilisation of communities as the solutions and skills are transferred to local staff."

    "The programme during this period has been clearing unusually heavily contaminated ground at Sayla Bari 2 minefield. NL sections have also been deployed to a new minefield at Dobagoryaale, which impacted productivity due to the time required for community liaison and minefield setup. This reporting period also experienced delays in clearance due to the rainy season, which disrupted operations. Significantly though the clearance rates over the duration of the contract have been on average c.900m2 under the anticipated clearance rates. This underachievement is likely to continue and a revised outputs forecast will be submitted with the programmes 2019 Annual Work Plan.",
    "Outputs for this quarter were lower due to the reasons expressed in the Annual work plan 2019: a partner donor provided additional funding in Q4 2018 on a strictly time limited basis. HALO absorbed these funds and sought approval to move 14 NL funded manual section months into Q1 2019, along with EUR59,654 that was unspent - i.e. all NL manual teams for Q4 apart from one. This has had an effect on manual outputs, with 14 months of 3,500m2 average clearance not undertaken. This equates to a deficit of 49,000m2. Mech teams still worked and produced higher outputs than anticipated of 17,215m2.",
    "Productivity this quarter was higher due to clearance on a task with 'ideal' circumstances for demining: large areas with open ground, low contamination, medium vegetation, loose soil, and experienced deminers.",
    "Productivity was high in Q2 due to teams working on a task with very permissible demining conditions; clearance rates are expected to drop in future quarters as teams move onto other tasks.",
    "Productivity continued to be high as teams worked on tasks with permissible terrain.",
    "No clearance occurred this quarter",
    "South central cleared 3757m2 while SL cleared 26419m2.",
    "Somaliland cleared 75871m2 and South Central cleared 22652m2",
    "Three road tasks were completed during this quarter, namely Golebed, Las Xadhaadh Road and Dhun Gorayo Road.",
    "HT-BAC-0004 completed",
    "Daraweyne completed (HT-MF-4213)",
    "We are working on BAC task 004 just outside of the town of Guriel. It is a large BAC task that we have been working on for several months. During the Said Barre regime the area was used by the SNA to store equipment and munitions in four bunkers which later exploded, littering the area with kick out. It is a priority task for us due to the large well in the centre of the task. The mix of open ground and the presence of ammunition bunkers makes clearance rates very variable, with rates much higher on open ground compared with areas around the bunkers. Much of the clearance this quarter was on open ground.",
    "Clearance rates this quarter slowed due to a) a slightly reduced capacity during section commander training in April, b) an extended stand down for Ramadan, c) manual mine-clearance training running from mid-June to the first week of July, and d) clearance of an area of obscured ground (garbage patch) and use of new SOPs to do so.",
    "Clearance rates slowed due to the teams clearing a collapsed ammunition bunker in the task",
    "Clearance rates slowed this quarter as teams focused solely on the manual excavation of substantial amounts of debris, dirt, and rubble within the site of the ammunition explosion. The operational period was reduced this quarter due to stand down for Christmas",
    "Clearance rates remain slower as BAC teams move towards finishing BAC task. They are currently removing dense rubble from the site through labour intense manual excavation",
    "Worked on a large road task this quarter",
    "A significantly large number of items of UXO were found and destroyed this quarter due to teams in south-central Somalia clearing a destroyed ammo bunker.",
    "These numbers are more typical of what is expected during this phase of the BAC task.",
    "Fewer UXO found at centre of explosion compared to numbers in previous quarters but proportional to the metres cleared and type of ground",
    "A significantly large number of SAA rounds were found and destroyed this quarter due to teams in south-central Somalia clearing a destroyed ammo bunker.",
    "These numbers are more typical of what is expected during this phase of the BAC task.",
    "These numbers are high due to clearing a collapsed ammunition bunker",
    "Large amount of SAA  due to the continued clearance of a collapsed ammunition bunker",

    "The deployment cycle was changed from a 4-week to a 6-week cycle to allow for more time to fix vehicles and prepare for deployment, this lead to a longer stand down period during Q5 and therefore a lower output. Also, there were short term funding opportunities exploited by HALO, which required a temporary reduction in the number of NL funded teams in mid-2017.",
    "14 manual section months were not undertaken as per the 2018 work plan and were moved into Q1 2019 (see Actual 2018 Q4 Comment). A deficit of 14 section months at 3,500m2 per month, i.e. 49,000m2, therefore applies and should be taken into account. When factored in, the 2018 target is 215,000m2. Total mechanical and manual outputs for the year reached 182,064m2, or 85% of this total. The reason for this underachievement is an overestimation of manual outputs at the proposal stage in 2016 (i.e. 4,400m2 per section month). With teams working on more heavily vegetated areas along the Somaliland-Ethiopia border, clearance rates have fallen to 3,500m2 per section months, resulting in a 15% underachievement for the year. This lower rate has been taken into account for the 2019 Annual work plan.",
    "In Somaliland, overachievement was due to over 85% of clearance by the Dutch teams in 2019 taking place on high-impact minefields on the border with Ethiopia. The terrain and lack of vegetation allowed for greater productivity on these tasks. As agreed in the annual plan 2020, six team months allocated for Q4 2019 have been carried over to Q1 2020. Accordingly 21,000m2 have been removed from the 2019 target of 126,000m2. The 2019 target is therefore 105,000m2.",
    "The original proposal assumed that four manual mine clearance teams would conduct 168,000m2 of manual mine clearance in south central Somalia in 2019, followed by 112,000 m2 in 2020. However, as approved following the 2019 Annual Plan, manual mine clearance teams in south central Somalia were dedicated to BAC activity for the duration of 2019, owing to security restraints around mine clearance tasks. In July 2019, HALO was able to open a new sub-location in South West state, where the operating environment is relatively permissible. This allowed two teams working in South West state to conduct manual mine clearance in 2020, while the two teams working in Galmudug state remained dedicated to BAC. Accordingly, HALO proposed a target of 522,000m2 for BAC and 20,000m2 for manual mine clearance in south-central Somalia in 2020. The initial projections for mine clearance in south-central Somalia reflected an average productivity achieved by Somaliland mine clearance teams; due to a different context in south-central Somalia the manual clearance rates have been adapted accordingly.  HALO requested that six manual team months to be deferred from Somaliland in Q4 2019 to Q1 2020. These two teams are projected to clear 21,000m2 over three months, bringing the overall mine clearance total for 2020 to 41,000m2. Correspondingly, these 21,000m2 were removed from the clearance target for 2019. In January 2020 21,000m2 was added to the manual clearance target, due to 9 team months that were rolled over from 2019 to 2020 in Somaliland. This took the total to 41,000m2. In July 2020, a further 79,200m2 was added to the target of 41,000, due to Somaliland acquiring an underspend from Dutch Yemen funding, which was used to fund an additional 24 team months. The manual clearance target was overachieved in 2020, due to overachievement of south central teams. South central teams exceeded the target of 20,000 by 13364m2. This is because security conditions in El Barde were permissible and did not disrupt clearance activities.",
    "This total has been revised downwards. The programme had previously been erroneously reporting areas worked, rather than fully cleared. The total is therefore 10 as opposed to 27",
    "Overachievement occurred due to the high rate of clearance in Q1. For the duration of 2019, the clearance teams have been working solely on BAC task 004 in East Guriel which contains a system of munitions bunkers from the Siad Barre regime. The mix of open ground and the presence of bunkers makes clearance rates variable with rates much higher on open ground compared with areas around the bunkers. Much of the clearance in Q1 was on open ground so progress was high. In Q4 teams focussed solely on the bunkers, so the surface area cleared decreased significantly.",
    "BAC clearance has been overachieved against the 2020 target as clearance teams in south central Somalia started a new large BAC task in July 2020. Teams pushed to complete BAC task 004 and then quickly moved on to task 0008 as presidential stakeholder meetings risked impeding clearance activities, so HALO pressed forward to complete tasks in case of any disruptions.",

    "The annual target for land returned to the community was exceeded due to a particularly productive first quarter. During this time, mine clearance teams in Somaliland were working on a task with large areas of open ground, low contamination, medium vegetation, loose soil, and experienced deminers, all of which contributed to the high clearance rates. The teams conducting battle area clearance in South-Central Somalia were clearing open ground which also allowed for high clearance rates.",
    "Total land cleared was exceeded against the 2020 target due to overachievement of BAC clearance and manual clearance in south central Somalia. As explained above, BAC teams started a new task in July which lead to high rates of clearance due to the low density of UXOs across the task. South central manual clearance teams exceeded the target of 20,000m2 by 13364m2. The teams were newly trained in March 2020, resulting in increasing rates of productivity of deminers by the end of the grant so they exceeded predicted levels of activity.",
    "This total has been revised downwards. The programme had previously been erroneously reporting areas worked, rather than fully cleared. The total is therefore 10 as opposed to 27",
    "Figures for the number of UXOs destroyed differ considerably between Q1 and Q4. This is because in Q1 the teams were clearing the area around the bunkers where there was a lot of kick out from the explosion. In Q4 the teams were focused entirely on excavating the bunkers where fewer UXOs were found.",
    "The EOD team will again be funded in years 2019-2020 when outputs will be delivered during the second phase of the contract",
    "These outputs have been achieved by manual demining teams responding to ad hoc community requests for EOD spot-tasks, when an item is found in the local area.",
    "The revised EOD target for 2019 is zero as agreed in the 2020 Annual Plan. The initial proposal stated that one CORE team would conduct risk education, nontechnical survey, EOD call outs and destruction of community held stockpiles of stray ammunition across south-central Somalia in 2019 and 2020. However, due to security threats at the EOD training location earlier in the year, it was not possible to train teams in explosive ordnance disposal and survey. Hence, the CORE team in 2019 has delivered risk education only. The target of 20 EOD callouts has been moved to 2020.",
    "Over-achievement has occurred as Dutch teams have worked on more tasks than anticipated during the contract to date, on tasks surveyed since the proposal was written. These tasks are near population centres, giving higher beneficiary figures than anticipated",
    "In the original proposal, indicative figures were given for direct and indirect beneficiaries of clearance activities in South Central Somalia during the Phase 2 period, 2019-2020.

As per the Annual Plan 2019, two manual sections are conducting BAC throughout 2019 in South Central Somalia as part of the postponed Phase 2 period.

The RE team worked in Guriel district throughout 2019 and were able to reach communities with relative ease. As a well populated district, the distance between communities small which meant less time spent travelling and more operational days to conduct MRE. In addition, the security environment in Guriel allowed for freedom of movement to conduct RE activities.",
