    "85% of the project activities directly mitigate and reduce the ERW threat (15250). The team progress from an initial phase during which they conduct MRE, victim and accident data collection and survey to the clearance of cluster munitions and EOD, and this continues throughout the 4 years of the project.",
    "In addition, the mapping of ERW as part of the project will help to co-ordinate local relief organisations",
    "The project will also provide support to our local implementing partner, the Syrian NGO Shafak, building their mine action capacity through training and project leadership. Shafak Organization is a Syrian NGO, a grassroots organisation that started operations in northern Syria in 2011. In 2013, Shafak was registered in Turkey as Shafak Syria. In 2015 its official name changed to Shafak Organization. Its activities include life-saving support for Syrians in conflict-affected areas in Aleppo, Hama, Idleb and other areas in Syria, including projects in Health, WASH, Food and livelihood as well as mine action. Shafak were one of the first NGOs to participate in the mine action sub-cluster in Gaziantep, conducting mine risk education and victim data collection within Syria. They signed an over-arching MoU with the HALO trust in 2015, with a view to expanding their mine action capacity and beginning clearance activities. They see mine action as a key part of their work stabilising and building communities' resilience and wish to train a Syrian national mine action capacity which will encourage employment and income generation. Shafak recognize the importance of empowering women as a key element in the development of society and economy, and constantly work towards this aim."

    "The first phase of the project trains a team of six people (consisting of a team leader, four team members and a liason officer) to conduct risk education in urban and rural areas across Northern Syria, particularly Aleppo and Idleb governorates. The team will target men, women, boys and girls: in order to reach children, the teams will provide risk education sessions in schools and focus on integrating RE messages into the curriculum; to reach adults, teams will deliver sessions in community centres such as mosques and women's centres as well as conducting house to house visits. As well as face-to-face sessions the teams will disseminate risk education materials, handing out leaflets and putting up posters. The risk education teams will also visit and collect specific information about victims of ERW accidents in their areas of operation. This information is used both to refer the victims to appropriate medical centres, and to inform risk education, allowing for the development of more targeted RE messages and streamlining of RE recipients. The data will also be used to target survey towards heavily contaminated areas. The teams will conduct rapid survey, judging the contamination level of each village or community they work in. During training the teams will be taught to identify the hazards which they are likely to find, and they will use this knowledge to complete a mobile contamination survey form as accurately as possible. All survey information will be reported to HQ and mapped by the GIS officer; it will subsequently be used to inform clearance activities. Teams will use Phase 1 as an opportunity to conduct community liason and identify the areas where ERW clearance is most necessary. During this phase, risk education and victim data collection (with referral to medical centres where possible) will build trust between the team and local communities. The project is currently underway in Aleppo and Idleb governorate."

    "Training took place between the 19th September and 3rd October, and the first data was recieved in Gaziantep on 16th October. This was partly due to recruitment issues, and partly as a result of the security situation, which meant that the team had to undergo stringent checks before being allowed access to schools. We expect to make up for these delays during the course of project. The team currently lacks 2 of the 8 members specified in the budget. One of these is the radio operator, who will not be necessary until the team start clearance activities, and the other is the field support officer, whose role has been filled by other members of the Shafak office, fullfiling this role. This role will be filled when team moves to another location where Shafak may not have additional personel in place to cover for this position."

    "This outcome was measured by the team members asking the people that they had delivered face-to-face risk education to about their increased feeling of safety. The questions asked were \"Do you feel safer now that you have recieved Risk education?\" or \"Do you feel more confident that you can recognise and avoid ERW after recieving Risk education?\". The indicator aims to stabilise communities in the immediate aftermath of war, by reducing feelings of panic and unsecurity caused by rumours and uncertainty.",
    "Previous beneficiary and RE activity data has been used to set anticipated targets for this indicator, based on the educational level within Syria, and anticipated targets of 80% (gathered from global RE figures). During the baseline period, short pre- and post- RE tests were introduced and the results were collected across the governorate and used to assess the increase in knowledge that the baseline attendees manifested.",
    "Previous reportage of ERW reported by other humanitarian actors working in the target areas was used to assess the baseline for this indicator. An increased level of ERW reportage is expected as a result of RE allowing safe behaviours to develop.  We are working with other organisations to assess a way of viewing decreased accident/death from explosives harvesting in areas that have already recieved risk education. However, we can tentatively, and qualitatively, set an increase of safe behaviours target at 30%, based on the opinion of the team after three months of working.",
    "In this context direct beneficiaries are defined as the number of Men, Women, Boys and Girls who were given at least 20 minutes of face-to-face risk education by a trained member of the team in groups of less than thirty people. These numbers were dissagregated by MWBG and the sessions were recorded on specially designed Risk Education forms. Indirect beneficiaries were not included as part of this indicator but the teams also reported the number of RE materials (leaflets, posters etc.) disseminated and the estimated number of indirect beneficiaries they had reached."

    "HALO works remotely through their Syrian partner organisation Shafak in Syria, and Shafak have conducted Mine Risk Education in partnership with other organisations in areas near the positions in Aleppo and Idleb governorates that we have been working in. In December our own team introduced the questions about feelings of safety \"Do you feel safer now that you have recieved RE\" and \"Do you feel more confident that you can recognise and avoid ERW after recieving Risk Education\".  The baseline survey includes information about increased feelings of safety which people have reported after recieving risk education from Shafak team members funded under different projects but in the same areas. It is important to have a area specific baseline because the threats vary so much across different geographic locations in Syria (those most affected by IEDs in former IS controlled areas, for example, are likely to report feeling less safe after RE compared with those at threat from ERW. 69 risk education sessions were delivered by the teams in December, to a total of 66 Men 63 Women 137 Boys and 149 Girls. Of these 72% of beneficiaries answered yes to one of the questions. The questions could not be asked of some of the adult beneficiaries due to cultural sensitivities, and in school groups, 1 out of every ten children was used to represent the group in the immediately post-RE survey.",
    "To measure increase in knowledge, HALO uses a simple test, which it plans to refine over the next 10 months of the project, so that the increase in knowledge indicated by the test must be statistically significant in order for the beneficiary result to be used. During the baseline period (ie between the start date of the project in September and 31st December 2016) HALO and Shafak  introduced tests - a set of 10 questions which beneficiaries answer both before and after they have recieved risk education, and during this period any increase in correctly answered questions was considered an \"increase in knowledge\".The tests used are identical for all beneficiaries, and this was a contributing factor towards the tests used originally being too easy to show a statistically significant increase in knowledge. The increase in the beneficiaries' marks between the before and after test is taken as their % increase in knowledge, and the first test used indicated only an mean 8% overall increase in knowledge among those who were considered to have gained knowledge - not statistically significant. As a result a new survey, which will also require a 3 month post survey, and is part of a KAP survey endorsed by all risk educators in the field in Syria, has been implemented since January 2017. After 3 months we will adjust the baseline in line with the new requirements. In addition, it must be noted that in school groups of 10 or more only 1 in 10 children will be tested on their increase in knowledge, and most adults must be indirectly tested. The names and contact details of those tested are kept, so that their increase in knowledge can be tested later in the project. An high % of IDPs in the community makes this a challenge.",
    "Assessing safe behaviours was not carried out during the baseline period. Although there is a chance that an increased reportage and marking of ERW can be used as a quantitative indicator of increased safe behaviours towards ERW, the security situation in Idleb and Aleppo governorates during the baseline period was too volatile to establish stable conditions for safe behaviours. We hope to establish this baseline later on in the project, in collaboration with other humanitarian actors working in the same areas of operations.",
    "The number of direct beneficiaries reached during the baseline period was 3,251 (M 277 W 269 B1504 G1201). The target set for the baseline period (between 01/09/2016 and 31/12/2016) was for 6,200 beneficiaries and 200 RE sessions."

    "No achievement in Q1 (target was 60 sectors). The proposed area of intervention for the teams in southern Idleb became unsafe due to the deteriorating security situation. The teams switched their focus to RE because the deteriorating security situation in Idleb resulted in over 900,000 IDPs forced further north (since Dec 2019), entering unfamiliar areas. As a consequence, the NW Syria Mine Action Sub-Cluster identified that RE to IDPs was a priority. A temporary switch from ECIS to RE was approved by the donor via email on 26 Feb. To be reviewed again in late late May.",

    "The number of RE sessions has exceeded the target due two main reasons. The first being greater accessibility than anticipated In some communities and the second being the large number of sessions conducted as part of emergency responses to IDPs arriving in the area, and refugees returning from Lebanon.",
    "Despite lower beneficiaries forecast for 2018 due to most of the large communities having already been reached and increased hostilities, HALO reached a similar number of beneficiaries to 2017 and surpassed 2018 targets.",
    "Male RE recipients is significantly lower than target. The team was comprised of three women and two men. Given the staffing requirements of the team, only one male staff member was conducting RE while the other was the Team Leader and spent more time in the office, coordinating the team. As a result, fewer men were able to be reached. Greater emphasis on children, and conducting sessions in schools, also meant that fewer men were targeted.",
    "Despite lower beneficiaries forecast for 2018 due to most of the large communities having already been reached and increased hostilities, HALO reached a similar number of beneficiaries to 2017 and surpassed 2018 targets.",
    "The number of female beneficiaries exceeded the target due to the presence of three women on the team as mentioned above. In Syria, women are often reluctant to attend mixed or male-led sessions and having women on the team meant they were able to hold many women-only sessions. In addition the cultural and social environment to allow women to attend sessions at all was less restrictive than had been feared.",
    "Despite lower beneficiaries forecast for 2018 due to most of the large communities having already been reached and increased hostilities, HALO reached a similar number of beneficiaries to 2017 and surpassed 2018 targets.",
    "The original Syria plan 2016 - 2020 stated the target was 200 x survey reports. The plan made reference to NTS but it was not clear if the target referred to communities or NTS reports. It implies communities but it could also be interpreted to mean NTS reports. A target of 200 communities in Year 1 is simply not realistic (equates to approx. 3-4 communities per week), on top of the team's significant RE targets. For this reason, I am inclined to treat the target as '200 reports'. No survey activity was conducted in Year 1. The 2016/17 report provided no explanation but I believe it was because HALO was unable to gain access to deliver face-to-face NTS training.",
    "The 2018 plan stated Contamination Impact Survey (CIS) would be introduced. The plan doesn't state CIS is a replacement for NTS but it is implied. The report only states that the commencement of EOD activities (assumed to include NTS) has not been possible due to a lack of access. The target of '200 reports' was maintained, which I am inclined to interpret as '200 neighbourhood report' not 200 communities, for reasons similar to those explained in Year 1.",

    "This figure greatly exceeds the target. Beneficiaries were asked whether they had greater feelings of safety directly after the RE sessions. The majority of beneficiaries reached with RE messaging had not received RE before and many were IDPs who were new to the areas in which they were residing and as such had little knowledge about ERW in the area. We would not expect such a high number were sessions to be repeated in these areas, or with beneficiaries who had received prior RE messaging.",
    "This figure was above target and is indicative of the fact that the majority of RE recipients had not received any prior risk education messaging.",
    "This percentage is low because most beneficiaries already have some knowledge of ERW/mines, which is reflected in the pre-test, so the increase in knowledge (between pre and post test) is not very high.",
    "There is very little accident data available in Syria and as such, safe behaviour is determined anecdotally in discussion with key community leaders. Through these discussions it was determined that 33% of beneficiaries demonstrate increased safe behaviours, slightly above the initial target."
