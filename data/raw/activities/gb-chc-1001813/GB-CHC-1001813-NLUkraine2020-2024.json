    "Clearance teams worked on seven clearance sites in Donetsk region. They worked on two mixed-threat minefields that required two-stage clearance to search for items laid with tripwire on the surface as well as sub-surface anti-vehicle mines. 40% of land cleared was in areas where remotely controlled vegetation cutters, known as Robocuts, removed vegetation first, which significantly sped up the search for tripwires. The teams were stood down on their annual winter stand-down in late December as sub-zero temperatures made manual clearance impractical or impossible.",
    "Clearance activities took place on five clearance sites in Donetsk region. Similarly to the previous quarter, teams worked in two areas with mixed threat types requiring surface tripwire clearance and then sub-surface anti-vehicle mine clearance. Clearance teams  were able to restart activities in the last week of January following the annual winter stand down.",
    "Clearance activities took place across eight clearance tasks in Donetsk region and 12 clearance tasks in Luhansk region this quarter. Spring weather condition enabled solid progress.",
    "Clearance activities took place on four clearance tasks in Donetsk region and eight clearance tasks in Luhansk region this quarter. Productivity remained strong.",
    "Clearance activities took place on two clearance tasks in Donetsk region and five clearance tasks in Luhansk region this quarter. Due to the winter conditions and the annual winter stand-down, productivity was lower than in the previous reporting period.",
    "Quality control (QC) visits from representatives of the MoD's National Mine Action Authority are planned for July and August 2021, on completion of QC, cleared areas can be handed over to communities.",
    "In September, two tasks that Dutch teams had worked on under this project were handed back to local communities following external quality control visits. In addition, external quality control was conducted by the MOD's Demining Centre for 13 further areas where Dutch-funded teams have worked under this grant, where clearance has been completed. The COVID-19 situation permitting, these areas will be handed over to communities in the coming months.",
    "17 areas where Dutch clearance teams had worked on under this project were handed over to local communities. 13 of these underwent external quality control visits in the previous quarter, and four more underwent external quality control in October.",

This reflects the fact that Dutch-funded clearance teams have worked on more than one minefield near to the same settlement at different stages in the contract; some individuals previously counted as indirect beneficiaries, are now counted as direct beneficiaries on minefields worked on later, so they have been deducted from the earlier indirect beneficiary count.",

    "The COVID-19 situation has severely limited the Dutch-funded NTS team’s opportunities to conduct EORE. Their EORE activities were planned to complement their NTS work and take place alongside in similar locations. However, thus far, their NTS work has focused on areas in or near the buffer zone, where the need is greatest but where there is also a disproportionately high number of elderly and disabled people, who are particularly vulnerable to infection. Consequently, given high rates of COVID-19 in Ukraine, gathering groups of such vulnerable people together for sessions or even going door-to-door has been considered unnecessarily risky. In addition, in this quarter schools were largely closed for the summer holidays and access to summer camps was limited for external visitors due to COVID-19 precautions.HALO Ukraine has requested permission to focus the cross-trained team's work on survey activities throughout the rest of the grant and move away from EORE. The aim is to complete a full baseline survey of mine/ERW contamination in Ukrainian Government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.",
