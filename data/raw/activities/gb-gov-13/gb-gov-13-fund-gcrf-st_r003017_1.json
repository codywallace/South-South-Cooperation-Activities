    "To build international collaborations in LMIC countries contaminated by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) to determine how; robotics, space, aerial and ground-based sensing can help improve the land-release process, increase productivity and provide better safety for the survey and eventual clean-up of environments contaminated by explosive hazards. To also help educate representatives from LMIC countries regarding benefits provided by autonomous & semi-autonomous robotics, both airborne and ground-based. Building collaborations, staging a workshop and completing a feasibility study is expected to lead to large scale, follow on project developing systems and field testing techniques aimed at helping deal with deadly contamination that has plagued Southeast Asia for decades.",

It aims to maximise the impact of research and innovation to improve lives and opportunity in the developing world."
