    "Within the framework of South-South exchanges in which Colombia has engaged with some countries in Africa, the National Government has identified the need to advance a cooperation agreement between the APC and the IOM. The purpose is to design and implement a program, with a Colombian stamp, that allows sharing the experiences, carried out by the last years in the framework of the implementation of the Peace Agreement, as well as in other processes of DDR, with other countries. These countries share similarities related to the context and specific challenges in overcoming conflicts. \n \nFurthermore, for the development of this agreement, it is proposed to first hold meetings with the APC and the State partners identified to gather the offer. This will provide inputs to design the peacebuilding program that the APC aims to transfer to prioritized countries. Considering these, it is necessary to jointly design a learning path with the APC for this first stage. Subsequently, this path will be transferred through exchange processes. As part of these exchanges, the implementation of a diploma program is proposed to facilitate the transfer of the program. For the final, the expectation is to have the program designed and transferred."
