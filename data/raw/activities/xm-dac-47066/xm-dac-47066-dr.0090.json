    "Climate change is a pressing issue globally, and its impacts are particularly acute in the Pacific region and the Philippines. This includes challenges related to rising sea levels, rapid and slow on-set disasters, loss of livelihoods, inadequate infrastructure and compounding vulnerabilities such as poverty, rapid urbanization, and weak governance which exacerbate vulnerabilities and contribute to displacement. Addressing the challenges of climate change and displacement requires a coordinated effort involving governments, communities, civil society organizations, and the international community. With each country with varying levels of capacity to cope with the challenge of climate change and displacement the importance to enhance south-south cooperation on the issue of displacement comes at a critical time. Through south-south cooperation, in the form of workshops among others IOM aims to improve the quality of emergency preparedness and response in the Philippines, and selected PIC to effectively address the needs of mobile vulnerable populations, including Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs)."
