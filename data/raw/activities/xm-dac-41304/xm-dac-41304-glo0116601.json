    "The United Nations is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Among its 17 goals, there is a strong movement towards increasing science, technology, and innovation (STI) on the international forefront, particularly as it relates to addressing the growing threat of global climate change. Higher education institutions, particularly in the Global South, play an important role in promoting STI on a global scale through their (1) teaching and learning, (2) research and engagement, and (3) organizational management efforts. As such, this project will set up and launch the South-South University Cooperation Network (SUCN) to support meaningful youth engagement and leadership in STI and SDG impacts through better attainment in higher education through SUCN and to achieve greater international collaboration across higher education institutions in the Global South and ultimately worldwide, particularly in regards to STI.\r\n\r\nThe proposed SUCN will bring together 11 leading universities, which can potentially function as the network regional and sub-regional hubs, and other member universities from four (4) UNESCO Global South regions (Africa, Asia and Pacific, Arab States, and Latin America and the Caribbean) to achieve the following key outputs and related activities:\r\n\r\na. Greater access to capacity building among Global South youth at higher education level, as achieved through a comprehensive bootcamp programme with a focus on greening higher education for sustainable development, bringing together higher education students and other supporting stakeholders from both SUCN leading and member universities;\r\n\r\nb. Youth-led increased technology and innovation transfers across SUCN leading and member universities, as achieved through an STI Working Group, connecting SUCN universities to share, contextualize, and implement youth-led STI solutions (mainly greening technology) through the four major functions (teaching and learning, research and development, community and industry engagement, and management and administration) of greening higher education, addressing SDG 13 through 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 17;\r\n\r\nc. Promotion of innovative South-South cooperation partnerships, as achieved through a Global South Forum, designed to promote technological innovation and interagency dialogue across the Global South Network; and\r\n\r\nd. Greater evidence-based policy advocacy in higher education institutions, as achieved through ongoing monitoring & evaluation efforts to assess institutional readiness for the SUCN network and opportunities for STI-related activities."
