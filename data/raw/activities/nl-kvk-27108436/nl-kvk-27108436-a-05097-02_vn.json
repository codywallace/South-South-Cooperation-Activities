    "COP21 in Paris in December 2015 saw a historic moment with over 190 countries agreeing to a long awaited global deal to take actionon climate change. Whilst some progress was made to limit temperature increases, there remains slow progress on the finance needed by developing countries to adapt and develop with a low carbon pathway. Whilst traditional donors made some additional commitments in 2015, finance pledged for adaptation remains a drop in the ocean. Meanwhile new donors are emerging. During the climate change negotiations China made an unprecedented announcement to deliver US$3.1bn for south-south cooperation on climate change and are now in the process of deciding how to use this funding. The Chinese government#s National Development and ReformCommission (NDRC) will manage this fund.\nOxfam have for many years called for more and better climate finance from donors to deliver on the needs of vulnerablecommunities and countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change. To this effect, a high level delegation from NDRC will spend 10 days, firstly to spend each 3-day in Vietnam and Laos for field visit, then to join the 2-day conference in Cambodia for up to 50 participants from stakeholders at local, national, regional and international level ofdifferent Asian countries,. This proposed project is designed to organize the field visit in Vietnam in August with one programme approach.\nThis activity will provide a historic opportunity for building relationships with and influencing both Chinese government and Vietnamese government, on the flow of finance towards climate change adaptation. The local communities and civil society in Vietnam will learn how to engage with Chinese government on the shaping its climate finance mechanism to be responsible, transparent and accountable. It could become a champion among all other international climate finance mechanisms such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and others, and promote all of them to race to the top. Eventually the local communities could gain benefits to mitigate the impacts of climate change."
