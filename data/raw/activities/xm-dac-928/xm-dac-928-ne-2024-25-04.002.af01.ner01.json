    "The Secretariat will place greater emphasis on country impact at the centre of its work. This will mean greater investments in country office capacities, built around a core predictable country presence, to drive more strategic cooperation with Member States. The investments will anchor on enhanced leadership in country offices, with the right delegated authority, empowered to make timely decisions to deliver in the most effective and efficient way possible. Ways of working will be more streamlined, yet more accountable and transparent, removing duplication and fragmentation of processes. \nThe Secretariat will engage all countries in strategic, advocacy and policy dialogue, based on high-quality data and projections, in order to highlight how specific changes in policy could affect their health outcomes. Data will be used to measure improvements and country case studies will be used to better understand progress and challenges.\n\nThrough the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All and working across the three levels of the Organization, the Secretariat will provide leadership, catalyse and further improve collaboration and alignment among the 13 multilateral agencies active in health in order to accelerate progress on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, in line with feedback and suggestions received from governments.\n\nThe Secretariat will increase its internal capacity for health diplomacy, strengthen coherence in its external relations and increase its support for Member State delegations in the area of health diplomacy and participation in governing body meetings. The Secretariat will also bring a gender, equity and inclusion perspective to leadership and governance and encourage the participation of young people.\n\nThe Secretariat will provide effective support to governing body sessions. It will design and apply innovative solutions to support the preparation and delivery of meetings of the governing bodies. In addition, it will implement the outcomes of ongoing Member State consultations on governance reform in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner.\n\nThe corporate annual plan that drives strategic communications, will continue improving the understanding and appreciation of the role and impact of WHO, with an emphasis on country content and alignment with modern digital communication. The Secretariat will continue its work on WHO?s branding, as an essential element of an Organization?s strategy and culture.\nThe Secretariat, through its high-level presence in New York, will raise the profile of public health in debates, decisions and resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council, and strengthen WHO?s role within the United Nations development and humanitarian systems. \nThe Secretariat will also enhance its visibility in United Nations inter-agency mechanisms to facilitate close ties with the United Nations Secretariat and other United Nations entities. The WHO regional offices will support and guide the engagement of WHO country offices with United Nations country teams for collaboration on health-related policy development and implementation.\nThe Secretariat will collaborate with intergovernmental and regional economic organizations and forums (including G7, G20, BRICS) to ensure that access to health services, health and well-being and health security remain high on their agendas. The Secretariat will engage and broker interregional cooperation, advocacy and collaboration strategies for learning and leveraging South?South and triangular cooperation.",
