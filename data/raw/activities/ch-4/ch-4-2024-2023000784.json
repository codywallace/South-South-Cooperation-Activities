    "As consequence of the Russian aggression, Ukraine is considered to be the most mined country in the world with approximately 30% of Ukraines territory possibly contaminated. This poses an imminent threat to life and livelihoods for returnees in liberated areas in Ukraine and for those who remained in their communities throughout the conflict and for internally displaced people. Fondation suisse de déminage implements mine action interventions, providing life-saving assistance through determination of the presence of explosive remnants, clearance activities and explosive ordnance risk education."
