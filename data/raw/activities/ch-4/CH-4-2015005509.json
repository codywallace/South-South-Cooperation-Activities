    "More than 20 years after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), landmines, cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war (ERW) still pose a serious social, economic, environmental and security threat. This last project phase will focus on the improvement and practical implementation of land release techniques and procedures, thus contributing to mine-risk free Bosnia and Herzegovina within reasonable deadlines and to sustainable improvement of living conditions for the inhabitants in communities previously affected by ERW."
