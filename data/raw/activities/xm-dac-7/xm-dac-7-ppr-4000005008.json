    "Through the Safeguard Young People Programme (SYP) UNFPA envisions a Southern Africa where all adolescents and young people aged 10-24 are healthy, productive and empowered; free from sexually transmitted infections including HIV, unintended pregnancies, child marriages and gender-based violence and equipped with comprehensive knowledge and skills regarding their sexuality, rights, and health seeking behaviours. The programme is an extension of the Safeguard Young People programme (SYP) which is the flagship youth programme of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) East and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO). SYP has been implemented since 2013 by UNFPA and its regional and national partners, under the leadership of the Southern Africa Dev elopment Community (SADC) Secretariat and is in its 3rd phase. This phase builds upon the achievement of the 1st and 2nd phase which were designed to address the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) needs of adolescents and young people with a focus on scaling up interventions through a multi-sectoral approach, addressing policy, integrated HIV and SRHR adolescent responsive health services, Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) for in- and out-of-school young people as well as youth leadership, participation, empowerment and accountability. During this phases key strategies and interventions will be identified to foster the institutionalization of successful models with a focus on quality, integration, sustainability and scale. SYP has been implemented in eight Southern African countries (Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) and will be expanded to Angola and Mozambique now. The three expected outcomes are: -       Improved inclusive policies, legislations and accountability mechanisms for the promotion and protection of adolescents and young peopleâ€™s rights at regional (SADC), national and sub-national levels with a focus on sexual and reproductive health rights. -       Adolescents and young people have increased knowledge, skills and agency to make informed decisions and positive actions about their body, their life and their world. -       Increased equitable access to quality SRHR, GBV and HIV integrated services, which are adolescents and youth friendly. In order to reach its objectives the project will, among others: - Support changes in laws, guidelines, and (health) policies and practices leading to decrease of barriers to SRH and HIV services in both Angola and Mozambique. - Assist both governments of Angola and Mozambique  to develop a demographic dividend implementation plan for investments on young p eople. - Train and empower 608 (600 in Mozambique and 8 in Angola) youth network members in advocacy for SRHR and youth development. - Strength 22 (12 in Angola and 20 in Mozambique) national and district networks so they can be functional on progressive laws and policies. - Enable two platforms (one in each country) that facilitate the dissemination of strategic information and monitoring and evaluation of the SYP programme at regional and national levels. - Release of 10 regional publications (5 in each country) through SYP on research studies and best practices. -  Undertake five South-South cooperation activities on ASRHR and youth development (3 in Angola and 2 in Mozambique) - Institutionalize CSE pre-service teacher training both in Angola and Mozambique - Develop CSE strategies for out school programmes both in Angola and Mozambique - 174 primary and secondary schools (80 in Angola and 94 in Mozambique) able to  provided life skills-based HIV and sexuality education in the previous academic year. - 16 districts/administrative units (5 in Angola and 11 in Mozambique) will have functional referral mechanisms betwe"
