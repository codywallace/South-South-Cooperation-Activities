    "Kärnstöd till Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) för genomförande av strategiska planen 2015-2018. GICHD är en expertorganisation inriktad på minhantering och explosiva lämningar av krig. GICHD arbetar i relation till nationella och lokala myndigheter, civilsamhällesorganisationer och internationella aktörer genom forskning, kunskapsspridning, utvecklande av standarder och kapacitetsstöd. GICHD har därtill en specifik roll och mandat att utgöra sekretariat för och följa upp IMAS - International Mine Action Standards.",
    "GICHD:s övergripande mål är att stärka efterlevnad och spridning av internationella konventioner angående min- och klustervapen; stärka nationella aktörer och processer för minhantering samt integrering av minhantering i den bredare mänsklig säkerhetsagendan. GICHD arbetar övergripande med konventionerna på området, på inbjudan av enskilda länder, samt i relation till civilsamhällesaktörer och myndigheter. GICHD rymmer sekretariatet för International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) och hanterar IMAS på UN Mine Action Service's vägnar."

    "According to the GICHD, mine action has seen significant progress over the last two decades since the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Treaty was agreed. In 1998, half of the countries in the world were contaminated by landmines and other explosives. Since then the number of new victims per year has been on a downward trend, 31 countries have declared themselves mine free and more than 53 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed. However, during the last four years this positive trend has been challenged and there has been a surge in the number of mine victims. This mostly related to the new conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere.\nDespite the negative overall global trend in mine action, the GICHD has achieved noteworthy results during the 2015-2018 period.\nDuring this period Algeria, Mauritania and Mozambique were declared free of mines. The GICHD, supported Mozambique during several years in various ways and the other two countries through the Arab regional cooperation programme. Hence, the GICHD supported these achievements to some extent.\nThe GICHD has support national mine action strategies in the following 8 countries during 2015-2018: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, South Sudan, Afghanistan, DRC, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and a donors strategy for the German Federal Foreign Office. The Zimbabwe national mine action strategy was the first national mine action strategy for the country and it has defined the mine action problem in a better way and facilitated work for the mine action operators which are now expanding operations, including with Sida funding through the Mines Advisory Group. (MAG). \nInformation Management is another core area for the GICHD. The Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA) -a data collection, storage, validation and analysis tool - was adapted in 2017. The latest version of IMSMA, named IMSMA Core, fully benefits from advanced technologies, such as unmanned aerial imaging and three-dimensional mapping for spatial data analysis and data sharing. From 2015 to 2018, the GICHD assisted 32 mine action programmes in developing and implementing their capacity in information management. A capacity development framework was used in 8 of those countries to assess progress in data, processes, organisation and resources, using 37 indicators. The overall score has increased in 7 countries.\nThe GICHD contributes to the development, review and promotion of the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) within the mine action community, as a member of the IMAS review board and as the secretariat for the same board. In addition, the GICHD provides expert advice and training on the application of IMAS at country level. Between 2015 and 2018, 14 standards and technical notes were developed or revised to reflect the reality on the ground as much as possible. The GICHD contributed significantly to that work. Given the challenges posed by IEDs in recent conflicts, a heavy focus was out on revising standards to enhance existing guidance related to the survey and clearance of IEDs in a humanitarian context. Furthermore, a new IMAS on Environmental Management in Mine Action was adopted. \nThe GICHD has supported several countries to develop and review their national standards (NMAS) in line with the IMAS. For example, Lebanon has adopted NMAS chapters for land release, information management and quality management. NMAS were established for the first time in Ukraine, following workshops and consultations regarding good practices.\nThe improvement and implementation of the land release approach has made it possible to deploy costly clearance assets more effectively, resulting in considerable time and cost savings. In Sri Lanka for example, the civil war had left 64 km2 of suspected contaminated areas behind. The Sri Lanka Mine Action Centre was trained by GICHD experts on the implementation of non-technical surveys. In 2015 alone, 18.7 km2 of land previously considered potentially contaminated were cancelled – this represents almost 90% of all suspected hazardous areas in 4 provinces. The experience and knowledge that the country obtained from the GICHD significantly contributed to implement this successful process, and Sri Lanka has now a much clearer picture of the level and location of mine and ERW contamination on its territory. This work together with an increased national ownership in Sri Lanka and increased efforts by operators makes Sri Lanka to be on track to be declared free of mines in the next few years."
