    "Stöd till Iraks regering genom FN i syfte att skydda civila som påverkas av minor och explosiva lämningar för att möjliggöra humanitära åtgärder, socioekonomisk utveckling och välfärd.",
    "Support for the Iraqi Government through UN in order to protect civilians affected by mines and explosives to enable humanitarian action, socio-economic development and welfare.\nThis is done through cooperating with the national authority DMA (Directorate of Mine Action) together with capacity development to national implementing organisations, and through explosive ordnance risk education.",
    "In areas that have been retaken from Daesh, there is considerable damage to buildings and infrastructure, and it is also difficult to earn a living. Rebuilding basic social services such as health care, schools, water and electricity supply and infrastructure is a major challenge, while it also provides an opportunity to create conditions for returnees, stabilisation and sustainable development. It requires clearance of the areas abandoned during the conflicts or remaining unexploded ammunition and other booby traps.\n\nThe programmatic approach presented by UNMAS aims to support the Government of Iraq in the work to protect civilians impacted by explosive ordnance and enabling humanitarian action, socio-economic development and welfare. UNMAS Iraq is presenting their work under following strategic outcomes:\n\nStrategic outcome 1: The Government of Iraq effectively prioritizes tasks implemented increasingly by national actors. \n\nStrategic outcome 2: People at risk recognize how to mitigate the threat of explosive ordnance.\n\nStrategic outcome 3: Safe access to restore or facilitate use of contaminated land and infrastructure is enabled.\n\nThe capacity of the Government of Iraq (GoI) to lead and manage national mine action response needs support. The outcome 1 The Government of Iraq effectively prioritizes tasks implemented increasingly by national actors of the programme intervention is set up to conduct capacity support to GoI to enable there long term capacity building to manage the national mine action structure in line with international obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, the convention on Cluster Munition and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. The outcome 1, is divided into two outputs:\n\n- National Mine Action Authorities have increased capacity to led and coordinate the sector.\n\n- National operators have increased capacity to deliver mine action activities.\n\nThe other two outcomes are focus on people at risk, to be able to recognize how to mitigate the threats of explosive ordnance which includes education and awareness at-risk communities and while outcome 3 focus on safe access to restore or facilitate use of contaminated land and infrastructure.\n\nThe last outcome is a response to support clearance in contaminated areas where assessments, explosive ordnance clearance will be carried out including quality management of the work.\n\nThese outcomes aims to support National Mine Action Authorities to have increased capacity to lead and coordinate the sector and to give risk education and awareness to communities in high risk areas. The outputs are also a response to explosive ordnance for clearance to be delivered in contaminated areas."
